AB  - The nonmedical use of prescription drugs, particularly opioids, sedatives, and stimulants, has been cited as epidemic in the United States, accounting for increasing numbers of emergency department visits and deaths from reactions and overdoses. The prevalence of prescription drug abuse is similar among men and women. Those who abuse prescription drugs most often obtain them from friends and family either through sharing or theft. Physicians should screen all patients annually and early in prenatal care with a validated questionnaire for the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. They should provide preventive education for all patients and referral for treatment, when psychologic or physical drug dependence is identified. Physicians should also educate patients in the proper use, storage, and disposal of prescription drugs. © 2012 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Background More information would be required for a better understanding of the actual circumstances of serotonin syndrome (SS) occurrence in routine clinical practice. Aim The objective of the study was to analyze characteristics of SS French pharmacovigilance reports, especially involved drugs and nature of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Method We performed a retrospective analysis of SS registered in the French pharmacovigilance database between January 1, 1985 and May 27, 2013. Only cases whose clinical symptoms fulfilled Sternbach, Radomski, or Hunter SS diagnostic criteria were retained for the analysis. Results Most of the 125 (84.0%) analyzed cases were associated with a recent change in a serotonergic drug (introduction, increasing the dose or overdose). Antidepressants were the most often involved serotonergic drugs, mostly serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs, 42.1%) and to a lesser extent serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (9.1%, mainly venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants (8.6%, mainly clomipramine), and some monoamine oxidase inhibitors (6.2%, mainly moclobemide). Nonpsychotropic medications were also involved, generally opioids (14.8%, mainly tramadol). Most of the cases (59.2%) resulted from pharmacodynamic DDIs, most often involving SRIs + opioids (mostly paroxetine + tramadol). However, SS also occurred with a single serotonergic drug in a significant number of cases (40.8%), most often SRIs (mainly fluoxetine) or venlafaxine at usual doses. Lastly, a major pharmacokinetic DDI could have played a role in 1/5 (20.8%) of cases. Conclusions This is the first study about SS based on a large pharmacovigilance database and published in English. Our results reveal not only the frequent involvement of antidepressants and tramadol, the importance of DDIs (both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic), but also the significant risk of SS even with a single serotonergic drug used at normal dose.

AB  - Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusions: Unusual clinical course The COVID-19 pandemic is a current global crisis, and there are hundreds of millions of individuals being vac-cinated worldwide. At present, there have been few reports of COVID-19 vaccine-induced autoimmune pro-cesses manifested as myositis, thrombocytopenia, and myocarditis. A 37-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a 3-day history of back pain and a 1-day history of left upper limb swelling with paresthesia and shortness of breath, 12-days after receiving the first dose of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. He was diagnosed with severe myositis compli-cated with rhabdomyolysis and non-oliguric acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, myocarditis with pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Screens for potential toxic, infectious, paraneoplastic, and autoimmune disorders were unremarkable. The patient was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin, with a good response. He was hospitalized for 16 days and discharged home on a tapering dose of oral prednisolone for 6 weeks. The case describes a possible link between Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and immune-mediated myocarditis, pulmonary vasculitis, myositis, and thrombocytopenia. However, further data are re-quired to confirm such an association. © Am J Case Rep, 2022.

AB  - Case/Program Description: We present a case of a 31-year-old woman who presented with generalized weakness. The patient stated she had fallen walking up stairs 3 weeks ago while moving furniture. She experienced bilateral ankle swelling following the fall. Patient stated that the bilateral ankle swelling progressed to bilateral lower extremity pain along with new onset bilateral shoulder pain which prompted her to go to her PMD. She was prescribed a muscle relaxant and ibuprofen which did not relieve the pain. After a week her symptoms did not improve and she went to the emergency room. There they increased her medications with the addition of tramadol. Later that week, she stated her heart was racing and felt dizzy which prompted her to go to the ED again. There she was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis with a CK level of 30186. On physical examination, strength in bilateral upper extremities was 2/5 and bilateral lower extremities 2/5 with the exception of bilateral knee flexors and extensors at 4/5. DTRs were 0/4 throughout limited by generalized edema. The patient was started on aggressive IV hydration for rhabdomyolysis. Setting: Acute IRF. Results: Her CK levels remained elevated above 15,000 for 3 weeks during this time she was transferred to the medicine service for further evaluation of elevated CK levels with muscle biopsy. The report of the biopsy stated: vigorous turnover (myonecrosis/ regeneration) of muscle fibers is consistent with clinically reported rhabdomyolysis, but there are chronic aspects in the pathology of the muscle. Small collections of chronic inflammatory cells, in the background of extensive myonecrosis/ regeneration, which include a sizable number of CD138(+) plasma cells, CD69(+) macrophages/ histiocytes, CD3(+) T-cells, and CD20(+) B-cells raises a question of immune mediated disease. There were also reticulotubular aggregates (RTAs) amongst the endothelial cells of intramuscular microvessels. RTAs are peculiar endothelial abnormalities that can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, Sjogren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, as well as HIV. Immunological testing for all of these diseases processes were unremarkable. The overall morphological observation raised high suspicion for immune mediated etiology underlying this severe and active necrotizing myopathy. She was started on Prednisone and the following day her CK level decreased by half from 14584 to 7791. Discussion: Necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (NAM) is a relatively newly recognized subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, which despite diverse causes, have the common histopathological features of myocyte necrosis without significant inflammation [1] along with simultaneous muscle fiber regeneration. [2] Patients present with a sub-acute severe symmetrical proximal myopathy, associated with a markedly elevated creatine kinase level. These are most likely immune-mediated, as they respond to immunotherapy. [1] Given the fact that the condition can respond to immunosuppressive therapies, further supports that this condition is immune-mediated, Although there is a lack of substantial immune cell invasion of muscle. [3] This uncommon condition may be confused with muscle damaging disease processes such as polymyositis or rhabdomyolysis. Medication induced necrotizing myopathy should also be ruled out especially with the prolonged use of statins. In patients with autoimmune necrotizing myopathy, which is sometimes classified with PM, scattered necrotic muscle fibers are present. Necrotizing myopathy is sometimes associated with anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) antibodies. The small amounts of immune cells that are present in muscle appear to be macrophages that are invading myofibers secondary to necrosis of these myofibers. There is no evidence of invasion of myofibers that appear otherwise morphologically normal, and inflammatory cells are not present in perivascular or endomysial locations, unlike in dermatomyositis (DM), PM, or inclusion body myositis (IBM). Unlike those with DM, hese patients do not exhibit perifascicular atrophy. Sometimes inflammatory cells are found around small blood vessels, and thickened basement membranes are seen. One hypothesis is that circulating soluble molecules may injure myofibers, but little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this entity. [4,5] There are subtle differences in the clinical manifestations of the various metabolic myopathies, but one of these conditions should be suspected when the following clinical circumstances are present: • There are recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis after exertion or in association with fasting or a viral illness. The last two associations occur most commonly with carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency and the other disorders of lipid metabolism. • There is a history of exercise intolerance, recurrent cramps, and fatigue beginning in childhood, and episodes of pigmenturia occurring in adolescence. • There is a family history of rhabdomyolysis or exercise intolerance, particularly in siblings, thereby suggestive of an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. • The individual has normal strength and muscle enzymes during interictal periods. One exception is muscle phosphorylase deficiency, a disorder in which chronic muscle weakness may develop after repeated episodes and CK levels do not return to normal between attacks. [6]Symptoms include an asymmetric or distal presentation of weakness, intermittent symptoms, painful muscles, marked muscle atrophy, family history of muscle disease, a history of medication that could be associated with myopathy, neuropathic symptoms or findings. [6] Conclusions: This is a case of a patient with autoimmune induced necrotizing myopathy with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) after a minor fall at home while moving furniture. The CK levels did not improved with aggressive IV hydration and the original diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was excluded. A muscle biopsy was done and raised high suspicion of immune mediated etiology and underlying this severe and active necrotizing myopathy. These patients can be distinguished from patients with rhabdomyolysis, PM, or DM by the persistence of symptoms and findings, including the elevation in CK, in the absence of treatment with immunosuppressives, dermatologic manifestations, and by their histopathologic changes. It may also be seen in association with an underlying autoimmune rheumatic disease, such as scleroderma or mixed connective tissue disease, may be seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome, or may be idiopathic. Patients originally diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis should be considered for this rare diagnosis when elevated CK levels do not return to normal after proper management and exclusion of other muscle damaging disease processes.

AB  - We aimed to determine the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II in poisoned patients admitted to the poisoning ICU and compare them to see which is a more sensitive and specific system for prognostication of the mortality and complications in these patients. Between February 2013 and July 2013, all patients referring to our centre with any poisoning mandating ICU admission were prospectively included. On ICU arrival, a questionnaire containing the demographic data, parameters of the APACHE II and SAPS II scores, the sum of the scores, complications during the stay and the patients' final outcome (compete recovery versus death) was filled for every single patient. A total of 195 patients were evaluated. Forty-two patients (21.5%) died. Mean SAPS and APACHE scores were 41 ± 16 and 15 ± 6, respectively. Mean SAPS and APACHE scores were significantly different between the survivors and non-survivors. Both scores could successfully prognosticate the development of the complications (p = 0.07 and 0.013, respectively). APACHE II was a better score in prediction of both mortality and later complications in the setting of poisoning ICU. APACHE >22 has a good specificity in determining the mortality and development of further complications in poisoned patients admitted to the medical toxicology ICUs. SAPS II score >59 and >43 can predict the risk of mortality and later complications in these patients, as well. © 2014 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society).

AB  - Neuropathic pain treatment remains unsatisfactory despite a substantial increase in the number of trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools. © 2006 EFNS.

AB  - Pediatric patients often undergo anesthesia for ambulatory procedures. This article discusses several common preoperative dilemmas, including whether to postpone anesthesia when a child has an upper respiratory infection, whether to test young women for pregnancy, which children require overnight admission for apnea monitoring, and the effectiveness of nonpharmacological techniques for reducing anxiety. Medication issues covered include the risks of anesthetic agents in children with undiagnosed weakness, the use of remifentanil for tracheal intubation, and perioperative dosing of rectal acetaminophen. The relative merits of caudal and dorsal penile nerve block for pain after circumcision are also discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To review the most frequent recommendations, doses and routes of administration of sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants in children, as well as the methods for monitoring the level of sedation. Sources: Review of the literature using the MEDLINE database and review of the experience in pediatric intensive care units. Summary of the findings: The continuous administration of analgesics and sedatives prevents the development of undersedation and is less demanding in terms of care than intermittent administration. Midazolam is the most commonly used drug for continuous sedation of critically ill children. Opioid derivatives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most widely used analgesics in critically ill children. Opioids combined with benzodiazepines, given in continuous infusion, are the drugs of choice in mechanically ventilated children, especially morphine and fentanyl. The use of protocols and monitoring through clinical scores and objective methods (e.g. bispectral index) allow adjusting medication more appropriately, preventing oversedation, undersedation, and the withdrawal syndrome. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as music therapy, noise control, adequate use of light, massage, conversation with the patient, are ancillary measures that help children to adapt to the adverse hospital environment. Conclusions: Sedation should be tailored to each child for each specific situation. Protocols that facilitate the correct selection of drugs, their appropriate administration and careful monitoring improve the quality of sedation and analgesia and avoid their adverse effects.

AB  - - Neuropathic pain refers to pain that originates from pathology of the nervous system. Common causes of neuropathic pain are diabetes mellitus, reactivation of herpes zoster, nerve compression or radiculopathy, alcohol, chemotherapy or abuse of some drugs, and trigeminal neuralgia. Specific symptoms of neuropathic pain are mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. Drugs to treat neuropathic pain can be divided into adjuvant analgesics (antidepressants and anticonvulsants), opioids and topical agents. The use of multiple drug therapies is common in practice. Despite considerable increase in the number of randomized placebo-controlled trials in neuropathic pain in the last few years, the medical treatment of neuropathic pain is still far from being satisfactory, with less than half of patients achieving significant benefit with any pharmacological drug.

AB  - Objective: To prospectively compare outcomes of laparoendoscopic single-site and multiport laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy, focusing on postoperative pain and analgesic requirement. Methods: Nonrandomized, prospective comparison of laparoendoscopic single-site and multiport laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and partial nephrectomy. Thirty-four patients underwent laparoendoscopic single-site (17 radical nephrectomy/17 partial nephrectomy); 42 underwent multiport laparoscopy (28 radical nephrectomy/14 partial nephrectomy) from February 2009 to February 2010. Laparoendoscopic single-site transperitoneal access was obtained by periumbilical incision through which all trocars were inserted. Laparoendoscopic radical nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy recapitulated steps of multiport laparoscopic radical nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy. Demographics/tumor characteristics, outcomes, and complications were analyzed. Results: Forty-two of 42 multiport laparoscopic and 32/34 laparoendoscopic single-site cases were successfully performed. Mean follow-up was 16.2 months. For laparoendoscopic single-site and multiport laparoscopy groups mean operating room time (min) was 159.3 vs 158.9 (P =.952); mean estimated blood loss (mL) was 175.7 vs 156.1 (P =.553); percent transfused was 2.9% vs 0% (P =.925). No significant differences in complications were noted (P =.745). Significant decrease in analgesic use (6 morphine equivalents vs 11.6, P <.001) and discharge pain score (1.7 vs 2.7, P <.01) were noted in laparoendoscopic single-site vs multiport laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. For laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy and multiport laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, no significant differences were noted for tumor diameter (1.8 vs 2.0 cm, P =.57), RENAL score (0.962), ischemia time (28.6 vs 27.5 minutes, P =.70), and preoperative (P =.78)/postoperative creatinine (P =.32). For laparoendoscopic single-site radical nephrectomy and multiport laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, no significant differences were noted for mean tumor diameter (5.6 vs 5.3 cm, P =.63), RENAL score (P =.815), and mean operative time (142.3 vs 155.4 minutes P =.13). Conclusion: In this well-matched, prospective comparison, laparoendoscopic single-site is comparable with multiport laparoscopic surgery in terms of perioperative parameters and may confer benefit with respect to analgesic requirement. Randomized evaluation and longer-term follow-up are necessary. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pharmacogenetics seeks to elucidate the variations in individual's genetic sequences in order to better understand the differences seen in pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism, and efficacy between patients. This area of research is rapidly accelerating, aided by the use of novel and more economical molecular technologies. A substantial evidence base is being generated with the hopes that in the future it may be used to generate personalised treatment regimens in order to improve patient comfort and safety and reduce incidences of morbidity and mortality. Anaesthetics is an area of particular interest in this field, with previous research leading to better informed practice, specifically with regards to pseudocholinesterase deficiency and malignant hyperthermia. In this review, recent pharmacogenetic data pertaining to anaesthetic drugs will be presented and possible future applications and implications for practice will be discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bariatric surgery has become a common procedure and several complications have been reported. The objective of this report is to present a case of gluteal compartment syndrome that evolved to acute renal failure after bariatric surgery and to discuss the diagnosis, and the prophylactic and therapeutic measures. CASE REPORT: A 42 years old male patient, white, with a body mass index (BMI) of 43, physical status ASA II, who underwent bariatric surgery of the duodenal switch type, under general anesthesia associated with epidural anesthesia. There were no complications during the procedure. The anesthetic-surgical procedure lasted 3 hours and 30 minutes. On postoperative day one the patient developed lumbosacral and gluteal pain, besides paresthesia in the lower limbs in the distribution of the sciatic nerve. On physical exam, the buttocks were slightly pale, tight, swollen, and painful to palpation and to movement. A diagnosis of gluteal compartment syndrome was made; it evolved to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. The renal function improved and the patient did not present any motor or sensitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery may present gluteal compartment syndrome as a complication. When it is not diagnosed and treated promptly, it may evolve to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, which represents a serious life-threatening situation. © Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia, 2006.

AB  - Introduction: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening entity associated with pro-serotonergic medications in therapeutic use, in overdose, or when co-administered with other drugs. A broad range of drugs and drug combinations have been associated with serotonin syndrome. Metaxalone overdose associated with serotonin syndrome has not been previously reported. Case Report: (Case 1) A 23-year-old female overdosed on tramadol and metaxalone. She developed dysautonomia, diaphoresis, lower extremity rigidity and spontaneous clonus, flaccid upper extremities, and hyperthermia 5 h after ingestion. Her course was complicated by status epilepticus. (Case 2) A 56-year-old female overdosed on metaxalone and was found unresponsive. She developed dysautonomia, lower extremity rigidity and spontaneous clonus, flaccid upper extremities, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and hyperthermia. Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade and cooling blankets were required to control hyperthermia in both cases. Serum metaxalone levels were markedly elevated in both cases. Conclusion: These are the first reported cases of metaxalone overdose associated with serotonin syndrome, which may be related to monoamine oxidase inhibition.

AB  - Objective: To describe acute compartment syndrome (CS) of the muscles of mastication in a working dog associated with a traumatic training event. Case Summary: A 2.5-year-old male Belgian Malinois was evaluated for acute blindness, severe diffuse swelling of the head, and inability to close the jaw following a traumatic incident during a bite training drill. During the exercise, the maxillary canine teeth were locked on a bite sleeve. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and ocular system identified diffuse muscle swelling and hyperintensity, most severe in the muscles of mastication. Ocular abnormalities were not identified. Rhabdomyolysis, CS, and indirect optic nerve injury were supported by measurement of increased intramuscular pressure. Bilateral decompressive fasciotomies over the masseter and temporalis muscles resulted in immediate and marked resolution of the swelling and jaw movement. Blindness, however, did not resolve. New or Unique Information Provided: CS involving the muscles of mastication may occur as a complication of bite training and may result in irreversible and even life-threatening complications. Emergent decompressive fasciotomy is indicated to reverse swelling; however, visual deficits may not resolve.

AB  - Neuropathic pain (NP) is a common condition characterised by subjective negative and positive symptoms that range from numbness to debilitating pain. NP can have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. Pharmacotherapy is typically the first step in treating NP. Guidelines and consensus statements from various organisations around the world appear to be consistent with the classes of medications recommended for both general and specific types of NP, which include antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Even with these first-line therapies, the majority of patients may not experience complete pain relief. This review presents epidemiological data, summarises available pharmacotherapy treatments and compares recommendations from key organisations, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) and the Canadian Pain Society, as well as other organisations. Information is presented about the screening tools used to help determine the presence of the disorder and classification of NP.

AB  - Purpose: A 22-year-old African American male was admitted for 10-month history of progressive, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Episodes occurred every two months lasting up to a week characterized by non-radiating sharp, epigastric pain associated with six episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis per day without specific triggers, and relieved temporarily with taking hot showers. Between episodes, patient was asymptomatic. On prior admissions, patient was found to have pneumomediastinum with acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis secondary to his severe nausea and vomiting. Previous negative work-up had been performed to include two EGDs, head CT scan, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis, and two gastric emptying studies. Thyroid function test, celiac panel, gastrin, chromogranin A, CMV, EBV, ANA, SPEP, UPEP, ACTH stimulation test were normal. On this admission, significant tests included: WBC 19,600/mm, creatinine 2.7 mg/dL, and creatinine kinase 9071 U/L. All other laboratory tests including liver associated enzymes, amylase, lipase, lactate, and urine drug screen were normal. CT scan of the chest revealed residual loculated air from prior pneumomediastinum. Patient was started on fluids, ondansetron and ultram with clinical improvement. Specific testing of urine synthetic cannabinoid confirmed the diagnosis of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). Since discontinuing these drugs, the patient has remained symptom free. Spice is one of several synthetic cannabinoid drugs that became available in the early 2000s which are used in an attempt to thwart drug screening. On literature review, there are 140 published cases of CHS. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case attributed to a synthetic cannabinoid. Clinically, CHS is characterized by history of chronic cannabis usage with a cyclic pattern of nausea, vomiting and colicky abdominal pain. Compulsive hot baths or showers with symptomatic relief support the diagnosis. On average, diagnosis of CHS after symptom onset is 4.5 years. Patients frequently have multiple hospital, clinic and ER visits with extensive negative work-up to include imaging studies, endoscopies, and laboratory testing. Treatment of CHS is cannabis/ cannabinoid cessation with fluid replacement and counseling. This case illustrates that CHS should be in the differential diagnosis of unexplained, episodic abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, particularly if relieved with compulsive hot showers, given the prevalence of cannabis usage in the United States. If testing for THC is negative, specific testing for synthetic cannabinoid should be done. Recognition of this syndrome is important to prevent unnecessary testing and to reduce health care expenditures.

AB  - Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is a complex procedure requiring a multidisciplinary collaboration between surgeons, anesthetists, and transplantation specialists. We will describe the perioperative management of a bilateral forearm allograft performed at our facility. A 40-year-old man who lost both forearms was registered on the transplant waiting list; a suitable graft was available 11 months later. Anesthesia required planning for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid therapy management and prevention of deep vein thrombosis. Blood loss was not quantifiable, which made coagulation management challenging. Reperfusion syndrome required the use of vasopressors. Postoperatively, moderate rhabdomyolysis without acute renal failure was observed. No complications such as thrombosis, hemorrhage, or opportunistic infections occurred during the early postoperative period. A comprehensive, protocol-driven, patient care strategy is crucial for the proper conduct of the surgical procedure and graft survival.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) continue to be the first-choice antidepressant treatment for the elderly as they have similar efficacy to other antidepressants but better tolerability. However, recent concerns have emerged regarding a range of adverse effects that are more likely to occur in the elderly. In part this relates to the increased risk of drug interactions. Platelet dysfunction induced by SSRIs with high serotenergic activity is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in the first month of treatment, although the overall evidence is weak. The risk of falls and fractures in elderly patients taking SSRIs is similar to that reported with use of tricyclic antidepressants. Hyponatraemia due to induction of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion may be life threatening in the elderly but in most cases is asymptomatic and reversible. Extrapyramidal disorders such as parkinsonism and dyskinesias are more common in the elderly but are rare. There is a very low risk of cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients taking SSRIs. There are inconsistent findings linking SSRIs with suicidal behaviour in late life and with the risk of cancer. Most of the newly identified adverse effects are either relatively uncommon or of debatable significance. Few differences have been identified among the SSRIs that are of clinical significance. However, it is recommended in the elderly that SSRIs should be titrated slowly to recommended therapeutic doses and used cautiously with other agents known to have the potential for drug interactions. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Tramadol is considered opioid-like analgesic with serotonin and monoamine reuptake inhibition property. This drug is used worldwide and is listed in many medical guidelines for pain management. Tramadol because of monoaminergic activities and opioidergic,has long been used as a well tolerated alternative to other drugs in moderate pain. Also, tramadol has less effect on the respiratory center than morphine and tends to control pain better on movement than morphine. Also, this drug when inject has less abuse potential. It produces analgesic action by exhibiting central serotonergic receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) catecholamine, and agonistic activity to mu-opioid receptor. Long-term use of high doses of this drug may be link to physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome; it is also possible that it can cause mental health disorders. Tramadol have several adverse effects, so the tramadol must choose carefully for pain management. There are a few evidence of seizure induced by tramadol at therapeutic dose. In addition, subjects with medical history of illicit drug abuse, seizure, alcoholism, epilepsy, head injury and metabolic disturbance have more possibility of seizures when treated with tramadol. The purpose of this review is to evaluate tramadol drug, clinical applications, complications, physiological and psychological effects, toxicity and toxicity.

AB  - Concomitant administration of atorvastatin, omeprazole, and dexamethasone has been shown to increase the serum concentration of serum hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A which can be associated with elevation of creatine kinase and an increased risk of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In this paper, we report a case of a 60-year-old female patient with stage IV colon cancer and compromised hepatic function receiving palliative care who developed rhabdomyolysis while taking atorvastatin, omeprazole, and dexamethasone. Atorvastatin was stopped, and the dexamethasone dose was decreased. Her case was complicated by urosepsis cultures revealing an extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing strain of Escherichia coli, and she died on the second day after admission. Physicians should evaluate the risk/benefit ratio of continuing statins in palliative care patients, and pay special attention to the monitoring of patients on statins and P-glycoprotein inhibitors regardless of hepatic function. © 2012 Elazzazy et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Central neuropathic pain (central pain) is treated with antidepressants, various anticonvulsants, opioids, and cannabinoids, but in many cases treatment is insufficient and associated with a range of side-effects. This review addresses a new treatment for neuropathic pain, the anticonvulsant pregabalin. We review the pharmacology, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, and safety of pregabalin as well as two randomized efficacy studies in central pain and a brief overview of efficacy in peripheral neuropathic pain. Pregabalin appears to have efficacy in treating central pain comparable to that in peripheral neuropathic pain as well as efficacy of other recommended drugs for central pain. Pregabalin also improves disturbed sleep and anxiety. Pregabalin is well tolerated; the most common side-effects are somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, and weight gain. Pregabalin is suitable for patients on multiple drugs although there may be additive CNS-related side-effects. Thus, pregabalin has a primary role in central pain patients. © 2007 Dove Medical Press Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of using anabolic steroids such as oxymetholone is increasing. This highlights the need for closely monitoring side effects of this drug. Acute renal failure (ARF) has been reported as a complication of rhabdomyolysis in anabolic steroids users. Case presentation: We present one 33-year-old man complaining of decreased urine volume, urine color change, and lower abdominal pain. He is engaged with a rare side effect of oxymetholone abuse. During assessments of potential medical issues associated with the intake of anabolic steroids, known side effects are known to be transient, but the need for appropriate interventions remains essential. Conclusions: Rhabdomyolysis due to drug use and the consequent acute kidney injury are among the lethal risks associated with anabolic steroid abuse. In most cases, the symptoms are extensive and often misleading. Therefore, detailed history taking, physical scrutiny, paraclinical testing, and early diagnosis are crucial for rhabdomyolysis patients.

AB  - Introduction: Many new psychoactive substances (NPS) introduced as recreational drugs have been associated with severe intoxication and death. Methods: Blood and/or urine samples were collected from intoxicated patients treated at Swedish hospitals that participated in the STRIDA project, a nationawide effort to address the growing problem of NPS. In patients undergoing evaluation for drug overdose, α-PBP was identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical data were collected during Poisons Information Centre consultations and retrieved from medical records. Results: From April 2013 to November 2015, 43 patients tested positive for α-PBP. However, α-PBP was never specifically mentioned during consultation but only confirmed analytically. The α-PBP concentrations ranged 2.0–13,200 ng/mL in urine and 2.0–440 ng/mL in serum. The patients were aged 19–57 (mean 34) years, 81% were men, and 73% were known drug addicts. All cases except 1 also involved other NPS and/or classical drugs. MDPV, α-PVP, and other pyrovalerone analogues were the most common other NPS (31 cases; 72%). CNS depressants were detected in 28 cases (65%), with benzodiazepines (16 cases) being most frequent. Main clinical characteristics were agitation/anxiety (59%), tachycardia (54%), and hypertension (37%), and 14 patients (33%) required monitoring in the intensive care unit of which 8 were graded as severe intoxications. No fatalities were reported. Conclusion: Patients with intoxication from α-PBP resembled those by NPS cathinones MDPV and α-PVP. As patients never specifically declared α-PBP intake and poly-drug intoxication was common, they may have been unaware of the actual substance taken.

AB  - Aim: To describe causes, manifestations, and diagnosis of serotonin syndrome following therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest. Methods: Retrospective case series from a tertiary academic medical center. Results: Three male patients suffered witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and were treated with induced TH. Initial cardiac rhythms included asystole in two and ventricular fibrillation in one. Following completion of rewarming, all three developed neurological signs unexpected for their clinical condition. These included rigidity, hyperreflexia, diffuse tremors, ankle clonus, and marked agitated delirium. Patients also were febrile, hypertensive, and tachycardic. A diagnosis of serotonin syndrome was made in all cases and serotonergic medications were discontinued. All three patients recovered consciousness and two made a full neurological recovery. One patient remained dependent on others for activities of daily living at the time of hospital discharge because of short-term memory impairment. Conclusions: Unexpected neurologic findings and prolonged high fever following recovery from TH can be manifestations of serotonin syndrome rather than post-cardiac arrest anoxic brain injury. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Hyperthermia is one of the most serious and feared toxic effects of substances of abuse (SOA) with sympathomimetic/ serotonergic effects. Unlike fever, the body heat increase is due to either central or peripheral mechanisms, and is not responsive to common antipyretic drugs. We present a case of patients with hyperthermia after recreational drug use. Methods: A retrospective study evaluating patients needing emergency medical care after the use of sympathomimetic/serotonergic substances and referred to our Poison Control Center. Inclusion criteria were hyperthermia (temperature >39 °C) and at least two of (i) alteration in consciousness, (ii) rhabdomyolysis, and/or (iii) excitatory neuromuscular manifestations. Results: Sixteen male patients aged 16-44 years were enrolled over a 6-year period (2011-2016). Overall, mortality was 56.2% (9/16): survivors recovered completely. Clinical manifestations that caused admission to hospital were characterized in most cases by early onset of hyperthermia and alteration in consciousness. Not all clinical data are available for a patient who died soon after admission with a body temperature of 41.7 °C. Among the other 15, rhabdomyolysis was present in 15/15 (100%), excitatory neuromuscular manifestations in 12/15 (80%), and acute renal failure in 11/15 (73.3%). Lethal cases worsened within hours or few days to multi-organ failure, coagulation disorders including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and finally irreversible hemodynamic failure. Toxicological analysis performed for each patient revealed sympathomimetic/serotonergic substances in 12/15 patients. No sympathomimetic/serotonergic SOA was found despite the history of consumption in 3 cases. The detected sympathomimetic/serotonergic SOA were cocaine (8/16), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) (6/16), amphetamines/methamphetamine (4/16), 6-APB (1/16), paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA)/paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA) (1/16); levamisole, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), heroin, tramadol, methadone, ethanol, and ketamine were also detected in 6 of these patients. In 6/16 cases, more than one sympathomimetic SOA was found. Conclusion: Hyperthermia occurring in sympathomimetic/serotonergic SOA poisoning is frequently lethal. The patients have the same clinical features as seen in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and severe NMS typical complications (renal and liver failure, multi-organ failure, and DIC). The clinical management of both NMS and hyperthermia due to substances of abuse is the same, and may include specific therapy with dantrolene. Similarities between the two syndromes suggest shared pathophysiologic mechanisms. Idiosyncratic occurrence hints at individual predisposing factors that require investigation.

AB  - Acute right heart failure in a young person is an unusual presentation and drug overdose is a rare cause. A case is described where the patient presented with striking clinical signs of acute pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, which were confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography. The precipitating event appeared to be poisoning by tramadol. There were features in keeping with tramadol toxicity and serotonin syndrome. The possible pathophysiology behind the process is discussed.

AB  - Polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing practices lead to higher rates of mortality and morbidity, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with complex medical conditions. Physical medicine and physiatrists face particular challenges given the array of symptoms treated across a spectrum of conditions. This clinical review focuses on polypharmacy and the associated issue of potentially inappropriate prescribing. The article begins with a review of polypharmacy along with relevant aspects of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the elderly. The adverse effects and potential hazards of selected medications commonly initiated and managed by rehabilitation specialists are then discussed with specific attention to pain medications, neurostimulants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antispasmodics, sleep medications, and antiepileptics. Of particular concern is the notion that an adverse effect of one medication can mimic an indication for another and lead to a prescribing cascade and further adverse medication events. Appropriate prescribing practices mandate an accurate, current medication list, yet errors and inaccuracies often plague such lists. The evidence to support explicit (medications to avoid) and implicit (how to evaluate) criteria is presented along with the role of physicians and patients in prescribing medications. A brief discussion of "medication debridement" or de-prescribing strategies follows. In the last section, we draw on the essence of physiatry as a team-based endeavor to discuss the potential benefits of collaboration. In working to optimize medication prescribing, efforts should be made to collaborate not only with pharmacists and other medical specialties but with members of inpatient rehabilitation teams as well. © 2012 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

AB  - Pharmacogenetics was initiated in the 1950s by the observation of prolonged postoperative apnoea due to an inherited reduction in metabolism of the neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine. The enzyme butyrylcholinesterase is responsible for the hydrolysis of succinylcholine. Besides the normal (usual, U) variant, there are atypical (A), silent (S), fluoride-resistant (F), and J, K, and H variants of butyrylcholinesterase with decreased hydrolytic activity or reduced plasma concentration. Malignant hyperthermia is a potentially fatal anaesthetic disorder whose inherited nature was recognised in 1960. Linkage analyses have located the primary genetic site of malignant hyperthermia in the gene encoding for the skeletal muscle type ryanodine receptor and today over 30 mutations have been identified in this gene. The standard diagnostic procedure to test for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is the invasive in vitro muscle contracture test. However, present and future research focuses on molecular genetic investigations for selected individuals. Of additional importance to the anaesthesiologist are the genetic influences on the pharmacology of opioids, benzodiazepines, adrenergic drugs, volatile anaesthetics, and responses to pain. Recent data also suggest an association between specific genotypes and the risk of adverse peri-operative clinical outcomes. Identification of such genotypes may not only provide insight into the variable responses of patients to anaesthetic drugs, but it also might potentially decrease anaesthetic morbidity and mortality through pre-operative risk assessment and administration of prophylactic therapy. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Adverse drug interactions increase morbidity and mortality. To prevent these, situations leading to adverse prescriptions must be clarified. This study quantifies and analyses prescriptions with potential adverse drug interactions in primary health care in the north of France over a 3-month period. Methods: All prescriptions administered between 1 January and 31 March 1999 were analysed to identify potential interactions amongst drugs appearing on the same prescription sheet. The regional French healthcare database was compiled to further classify contra-indications. Results: There were 5,358,374 prescriptions administered to 44% of the overall population of the Nord-Pas de Calais area (1,754,372 patients/3,990,167 general population). There were 14, 390 prescriptions classified as either absolute (26%) or relative contraindications (74%). Nine drug categories accounted for most of the absolute contraindications: dopaminergic antiparkinsonians, neuroleptic agents, migraine treatments (such as ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and other triptan derivatives), prokinetic drugs (cisapride), antibacterial drugs (macrolides), antifungals (imidazoles), antiarrhythmics, betablockers and analgesics (opioids and floctafenine). In 54% of patients exposed, the incurred risk was either QT prolongation/Torsade de Pointes or antagonism of dopaminergic antiparkinson agents with dopamine receptor antagonists prescribed as antipsychotic agents. Conclusions: Among a non-selected population of ambulatory outpatients, the number of quarterly prescriptions with contra-indications with potentially harmful drug interaction was 27 in 10,000 prescriptions. This would extrapolate to nearly 200,000 contra-indications on the same-prescription sheets in France in the first quarter of 1999.

AB  - Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) are becoming increasingly complex due to the rising prevalence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Medications are often essential to manage the underlying liver disease, complications of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and comorbidities. However, medication-related problems (MRPs) have been associated with adverse patient outcomes, including hospitalization and mortality. Factors that can contribute to MRPs in people with CLD are variable and often entwined. This narrative literature review discusses key barriers and opportunities to modify risk factors and improve medication-related outcomes for people with CLD.

AB  - The emergence of clinically efficacious prescription drugs to treat pain, anxiety, and learning disorders is accompanied by the potential for nonmedical use. Prescription drug abuse has become a modern-day epidemic in the United States and is now second only to marijuana use across all age groups. This article reviews the various data collection, analysis, and reporting systems that have been developed in response to the growing concern for nonmedical prescription drug use. The terminology used to categorize prescription drugs that are abused and the various definitions for abuse, misuse, and nonmedical use are discussed. The epidemiology of nonmedical prescription drug use and an overview of each class of prescription drug that is at risk for nonmedical use are presented along with details of specific drugs that are associated with significant morbidity or mortality. © 2010 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

AB  - LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize the risk factors for muscle injury associated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors CASE: A 54 year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and stage III chronic kidney disease presented to clinic with 2 days of “leg cramps”. The discomfort was “a sore ache” in both his calves that was worst at night. He denied a preceding viral prodrome, trauma, restless legs, dehydration, or distal parasthesias. He had taken gabapentin without relief. His other medications were amlodipine, atorvastatin, enalapril, insulin, and tramadol. His exam was notable for diffusely tender gastrocnemius muscles, without warmth, swelling, discoloration, or palpable cord. His distal extremities were well-perfused, with 2+ pedal pulses, and his sensation was intact to monofilament. He had full strength and ambulated without difficulty. Labs revealed an elevated creatine kinase (CK) (2605 U/L), creatinine (1.83 mg/dL, up from 1.65 mg/dL), and glucose (363 mg/dL). A urinalysis had been ordered but not obtained. Two weeks prior to presenting his atorvastatin had been increased from 20 mg to 40 mg nightly for persistently elevated LDL. Given the suspicion for statin-induced myositis, the patient's atorvastatin was discontinued and aggressive hydration was recommended. Repeat labs 3 days later showed a CK of 459 U/L and a creatinine of 1.46mg/dL. His cramps resolved over the following 2 weeks and his CK had returned to normal 1 month after his initial presentation. DISCUSSION: One in four adults in the United States over age 45 is prescribed an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (“statin”), a number sure to increase under the new ACC/AHA guidelines. Muscle injury is known side effect of statins and should remain a concern in all patients taking them, regardless of the duration of treatment. The degree of injury ranges from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis, and patients may complain of cramps, aches, fatigue, or weakness. The mechanism by which muscle toxicity occurs is not well understood. While the incidence varies among statins due to differences in absorption and metabolism, higher doses are associated with greater risk. Other risk factors include hypothyroidism and renal and liver diseases. Additionally, because many statins are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), concurrent use of medications that inhibit or compete for this enzyme, including amlodipine, increases susceptibility to developing myopathy. Myositis, as was suspected in this patient, is uncommon, occurring in 0.5-0.9 % of patients on statin monotherapy for hyperlipidemia. Resolution of symptoms and normalization of CK occur following withdrawal of the medication. For patients who develop muscle injury other than rhabdomyolysis, a trial of pravastatin or fluvastatin, two statins with less intrinsic muscle toxicity and not metabolized by CYP3A4, can be considered with close monitoring. While the occurrence of statin-induced myopathy is rare, the burden of disease from this adverse effect should not be overlooked when greater than 255 million prescriptions for cholesterol-lowering medications are written annually in the United States.

AB  - What is known and objective: Rhabdomyolysis is a severe potential adverse drug reaction of statin therapy. We report a case of rhabdomyolysis due to drug–drug interaction (DDI) between atorvastatin and fluconazole and review the literature. Case summary: A 70-year-old woman received atorvastatin for hyperlipidaemia without any problem for 4 years. When intravenous fluconazole was added for treating a fungal infection, rhabdomyolysis developed 2 weeks later. Removal of atorvastatin led to the resolution of her rhabdomyolysis. What is new and conclusion: Our case demonstrates that in some subjects even a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor such as fluconazole may lead to rhabdomyolysis in subjects receiving a statin.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is a debilitating and distressing complication that occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus. This article provides an overview of diabetic peripheral neuropathy focusing on DPNP. Areas covered: This article reviews the diagnosis, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic pain. A comprehensive and systematic Medline search of the published literature for treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was done from 1965 to December 2012. Studies not in English language were excluded. Expert opinion: Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat, and patients rarely experience complete pain relief. Despite several pharmacological agents being used in the treatment of DPNP, only duloxetine and pregabalin have evidence-based support for controlling DPNP. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Serotonin syndrome is a toxidrome that results from a heightened level of serotonin action in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Some drugs which are commonly used in the intensive care unit or during anesthesia could induce this syndrome. This potentially fatal toxidrome manifests with a constellation of mental changes, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities. Prompt recognition of the toxidrome and withdrawal of the offending agent are crucial to prevent catastrophe. We report the case of serotonin syndrome in a 30-year-old man in whom the presentation was profound with convulsions, hyperthermia, clonus, rigidity, altered mental status, and acute kidney injury resulting from rhabdomyolysis. Materials and methods: A 30-year-old man was rushed to the emergency room after an episode of fall, brief convulsions, and loss of consciousness which befell him at his home. He was apparently healthy before this event and had no morbidities like diabetes mellitus or hypertension. However, he had intermittent headaches and insomnia for which he had taken a combination of tramadol, ondansetron, and metoclopramide during the preceding 7 days. On admission to the hospital, he was irritable, disoriented, and febrile (temperature 100°F). His pulse was 110/minute, BP was 168/108 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 22/minute, and his oxygen saturation with ambient air was 97%. He had spontaneous generalized clonic jerks and the same was also provoked by noise (startle). Pupils were mid position and reacting. There was no focal neurological weakness; however, there was generalized muscular rigidity. Tendon reflexes were exaggerated and he had bilateral ankle clonus. The rest of the clinical examination was unremarkable. A computed tomography scan of the brain was normal. Hemogram revealed a normal blood count. Serum creatine kinase (CK - total) was 33,000 U, serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL on the day of admission, serum sodium was 138 mmol/L, potassium was 6.1 mmol/L, and bicarbonate was 17 mmol/L. Urine analysis revealed 1+ protein, microscopy revealed no RBCs but urine tested positive for heme and myoglobin. The liver function test was normal. During the course of his illness, he progressed to oliguric acute kidney injury with serum creatinine increasing to 6 mg/dL which necessitated initiation of hemodialysis. Kidney biopsy revealed myoglobin pigment induced acute tubular injury. Results: A diagnosis of serotonin syndrome induced by the combination of tramadol, ondansetron, and metoclopramide was made and the patient was managed with the cessation of offending drugs, hydration, benzodiazepine, temporary dialysis, and supportive care with which he made a complete recovery of consciousness and kidney function. Discussions: Serotonin syndrome results from a heightened serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous system predominantly in the 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors.1 Drugs that interfere with the metabolism and reuptake of serotonin increase the level of serotonin in the nervous system, thereby inducing the toxidrome. The list of drugs that could cause serotonin syndrome is exhaustive; however, common agents of interest to the intensivist include tramadol, meperidine, fentanyl, dextromethorphan, metoclopramide, ondansetron, granisetron, monoamine oxidase inhibitors like linezolid, selegiline, serotonin reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine, etc.2 Although any one drug on its own could provoke a serotonin syndrome, a combination of two or more drugs has a greater propensity to induce the toxidrome. Our patient had taken a combination of tramadol, metoclopramide, and ondansetron which had acted synergistically to induce serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by a constellation2 of mental status changes (like agitation, anxiety, disorientation, excitement, etc.), autonomic dysfunction (like hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, arrhythmias, etc.), and neuromuscular abnormalities (like tremors, clonus, hyperreflexia, and muscle rigidity). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia are close differentials for this toxidrome. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome is made clinically and relies upon the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria (HSTC).2 The HSTC requires the consumption of a serotoninergic drug with at least one out of the following five requirements being met: •Spontaneous clonus. •Inducible clonus with agitation or diaphoresis. •Ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis. •Tremor and hyperreflexia. •Hypertonia, temperature >100.4°F, and ocular or inducible clonus. This patient had altered mental status, hyperthermia, tachycardia, rigidity, spontaneous, and inducible clonus. Repeated clonus and muscular rigidity culminated in rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute kidney injury. Conclusion: Serotonin syndrome could present as a life-threatening toxidrome with acute kidney injury in extreme cases. Drugs that are commonly used in the intensive care unit or during anesthesia could induce this syndrome. Prompt recognition and withdrawal of offending drugs are crucial to prevent a catastrophic outcome.

AB  - Serotonin syndrome results from excessive activation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptors in the nervous system, on the surface of platelets, and on the vascular endothelium. The clinical manifestations are a triad of altered conscious state, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular excitability. Clinical diagnostic criteria remain poorly defined and unvalidated, and there are no available investigations to confirm the diagnosis. The syndrome is caused by the administration of one or more drugs possessing serotonergic activity. Severe forms of the syndrome usually result from overdose, but can be induced by monotherapy. The exact incidence of serotonin syndrome remains unknown, but is likely to be increasing due to increased prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and tramadol, as well as recreational use of amphetamine-like substances. Serotonin syndrome may complicate the administration of drugs frequently used in anaesthetic practice, including pethidine and tramadol. Although the majority of cases improve with symptomatic and supportive care, severe cases need intensive care and frequently require mechanical ventilation. Neuromuscular excitability is likely to be the cause of rhabdomyolysis seen in severe cases and should be treated with benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants. Supportive therapies are required to treat hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction. Cyproheptadine is the most commonly administered serotonergic antagonist, but is unavailable in parenteral form.

AB  - Hypokalaemic rhabdomyolysis is unusual, but the association between hypokalaemia and rhabdomyolysis can be overlooked if intracellular potassium leakage normalizes serum potassium by the time of presentation. This report describes a patient who presented with severe pain due to non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis and was found to have serum potassium of 1.4 mmol/L; magnesium 0.40 mmol/L; phosphate 1.40 mmol/L; adjusted calcium 1.87 mmol/L and creatine kinase 6421 U/L. In this case, intervention occurred before rhabdomyolysis could progress to the stage at which serum potassium may have self-corrected. This patient's hypokalaemia was at first refractory to treatment with potassium chloride, possibly due to coexisting magnesium deficiency. Initially, the patient denied alcohol abuse, but later admitted alcohol misuse prior to withdrawal three days before presentation. Hypokalaemia is associated with alcohol misuse, but abrupt withdrawal may exacerbate hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Acute or chronic myopathy is common in alcoholics due to alcohol toxicity and paradoxically the risk of rhabdomyolysis may be increased during periods of abrupt alcohol withdrawal. © 2007 The Association for Clinical Biochemistry.

AB  - Objectives: Beta-methylphenylamine is a component of some commercially available “fat burner” formulas increasingly used by body builders. Some of these formulas also contain high amounts of caffeine (150 mg of caffeine per cap). In treatment of adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) a licensed preparation of amphetamine has become common in Sweden. Mixtures of fat burners and central stimulating drugs may induce profound adrenergic activity leading to agitation, muscular rigidity, hyperthermia, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, confusion and finally circulatory collapse. We report a case of agitation and confusion after ingestion of multiple fat burners when on treatment with several psychiatric medications. A possible interaction was likely leading to a hyperadrenergic syndrome finally leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Case report: A 31-year-old man, 140 kg, with history of ADHD, panic disorders and substance abuse was on treatment with clomipramine (375 mg/d), lisdexamphetamine (130 mg/d) and flunitrazepam (1 mg/d). He was experienced in body-building and on his own webpage he declared a regular consumption of fat burners containing caffeine and beta-metylphenylamine. He was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after being found convulsing at home. At the ED he was disorientated, confused and aggressive. A drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and tramadol. The patient presented with extreme stress, tachycardia, hyperthermia, sweating and high creatine kinase (CK) concentration. He required heavy sedation with propofol and opioids, and was intubated and ventilated. Dantrolene sodium was administrated without any apparent positive effect. Treatment was instituted with dexmedetomidine, propofol, transdermal opioids and high doses of benzodiazepines. He was transferred to the psychiatric ward after 2 days but again became agitated and confused and was brought back to the ICU. Shortly after arrival to the ICU he collapsed and CPR was immediately instituted but this time he was unresponsive to resuscitation and finally expired. Conclusion: Medical treatment with amphetamines, tramadol and antidepressants in a patient with a regular consumption of fat burners may induce a hyperadrenergic syndrome with agitation, confusion, rigidity, hyperthermia, hypertension and tachycardia that may become extremely stressful to the cardiovascular system resulting in cardiovascular collapse and death. Warning to the public of several new fat burners containing different biogenic amines such as beta-methylphenylamine and caffeine seems to be appropriate as well as information to the medical profession of the dangers and risks of mixing licensed amphetamine preparations with some fat burners.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes. Up to 50% of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have diabetes-related PN. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy-(PDPN) accounts for 10% to 20% of PN cases, and these patients describe their pain as a sharp, throbbing, aching, or burning as being stabbed by tiny knives or bitten by hundreds of spiders or fire ants on their lower legs and feet; and as keeping them awake all night long. This article discusses the management of PDPN, focusing on the elderly.

AB  - Introduction: Transurethral resection of the prostate is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in men to relieve bladder outlet obstruction, most often due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, transurethral resection of the prostate may also be used in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who have bladder outlet obstruction. Acute kidney injury after transurethral resection of the prostate has been described and attributed to a variety of mechanisms, including acute tubular necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, and hemolysis with heme-pigment nephropathy. However, to our knowledge, no case of kidney biopsy-proven heme-pigment nephropathy due to hemolysis from a transurethral resection of the prostate procedure has been published to date. Case description: We describe a case of an 82-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer who presented with severe oliguric renal failure 2 weeks after transurethral resection of the prostate for bladder outlet obstruction. Laboratory studies showed evidence of hemolysis, and a kidney biopsy showed heme-pigment cast nephropathy. Conclusions: We hypothesize that the patient's kidney injury was induced by hemolysis resulting from rapid absorption of hypotonic fluid administered during the transurethral resection of the prostate procedure. Patients with prostate cancer undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate for bladder outlet obstruction may experience severe complications related to rapid absorption of hypotonic fluid. Our case illustrates the importance of nephrology evaluation and kidney biopsy in patients with benign and malignant prostate conditions who experience post-transurethral resection of the prostate syndrome and acute kidney injury in order to better characterize these complications, and to develop preventative strategies for future cases.

AB  - Background: The Internet is commonly used to advertise and sell medications and dietary supplements directly to consumers. Prescriptions are often not needed, and consumers may engage in unmonitored and risky health practices. No systematic attempt has been made to evaluate reported cases of adverse events following such purchases. Objective: To systematically identify and examine reported cases of adverse events associated with the purchase of medications and dietary supplements from the Internet. Methods: MEDLINE (1990-June 2009), EMBASE (1990-June 2009), IBIDS (to June 2009), TOXNET (to June 2009), bibliographies of identified articles, and Web sites of relevant health ministries and professional associations in the US and Canada were reviewed to identify eligible articles that describe adverse events associated with the purchase of medications or dietary supplements from the Internet. Results: Thirty-two reports of 41 cases of adverse consequences of pharmaceutical products (n = 31) or dietary supplements (n = 10) were identified. Purchases were made by people in the 30- to 50-year-old age group in 36% of cases. Prescription medications were implicated in 27% of cases and narcotic and controlled drugs were implicated in 49% of cases. Drug abuse was responsible for harm in 73% of cases, whereas adverse drug reactions occurred in 27% of cases. Nine (22%) patients died as a result of adverse consequences following such purchases. The remaining patients suffered serious adverse events such as seizures, liver damage, and hallucinations. Conclusions: An unexpectedly large number of case reports were identified from the literature; however, these reports do not fully illustrate the magnitude of the problem. Life-endangering adverse consequences signify a need for increased regulation and control of Internet Web sites and a need for healthcare provider involvement. Pharmacists should know where their patients obtain medications, how to verify the validity of the sources of prescriptions, and how to report adverse consequences.

AB  - Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of striated muscle cells resulting in leakage of cell matter into the extra-cellular space. It can present with myalgia, muscle weakness and swelling. Episodes of passing of dark tea-coloured urine have also been reported. Raised creatinine kinase is diagnostic of rhabdomyolysis. Raised serum myoglobin levels and presence of myoglobin in the urine (myoglobinuria) help to support the diagnosis. The aetiology for rhabdomyolysis can be both traumatic and non-traumatic. In the case of trauma, individuals with crush injuries trapped in cars or under collapsed buildings , struggling against restraints, immobilized and in the same position for hours due to injuries, comatosed states or positioning during prolonged surgeries and those with high voltage electrical injuries are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. Non-traumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis include hyperthermia, metabolic myopathies, drugs and toxins ingestions, electrolyte abnormalities and infections. The mechanism of rhabdomyolysis is often multifactorial. In the case of trauma, direct injury to cell membranes as well as hypoxia from direct compression leading to adenosine triphosphate depletion leads to breakdown of striated muscle cells.. The lysed cells release myoglobin, creatine kinase, urate and phosphate into the interstitium. Direct heme protein-induced toxicity on nephrons can result in acute kidney injury. We report a case of traumatic rhabdomyolysis and share the latest in the literature on the understanding of the subject as well as that of myoglobinuria, with which it is often associated with.

AB  - We present the case of a 24 yr old male who was diagnosed with gluteal compartment syndrome and was subsequently found to have developed lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy and complex regional pain syndrome. The patient’s gluteal compartment syndrome was diagnosed within 24 h of presentation to the emergency room, and he underwent emergent compartment release. While recovering postoperatively, persistent weakness was noted in the right lower limb. Results of electrodiagnostic testing were consistent with a lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy. After admission to inpatient rehabilitation, the patient complained of pain, burning sensation, and numbness in the distal right lower limb. Based on clinical findings, he was diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome type II, or causalgia, and was referred for a lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopic guidance. Sympathetic block resulted in relief of the patient’s symptoms. He was discharged home with good pain control on oral medications.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The use of levetiracetam (LEV) in the management of drug-induced seizures has not been systematically investigated. Repetitive and continuous seizures that do not respond to benzodiazepines require second line therapy. Levetiracetam has a unique receptor binding site, rapid absorption, no known cardiac effects at therapeutic doses, and is theoretically a good candidate for use in drug-induced seizures. We evaluate the safety of LEV and its association with seizure cessation in this retrospective chart review of patients who received LEV as a control agent in drug-induced seizures. Methods: We identified the medical records of patients presenting to an urban, level 1 trauma center between 1 January 2010 and 31 May 2015 by ICD-9 codes based on the following: (1) a poisoning diagnosis, (2) a seizure diagnosis, and (3) administration of LEV. We included patients with a drug-induced seizure based on history, electroencephalogram results, blood alcohol concentrations, urine drug screens, and adequate documentation. We excluded patients with alcohol withdrawal, anoxic brain injury, subtherapeutic concentrations of other antiepileptics, hypoglycemia, and pseudoseizures. Primary outcomes of interest included cessation of active seizures or the prevention of seizure recurrence. We assessed safety by the presence or absence of adverse drug effects (ADE) attributed to the administration of LEV. Results: Thirty-four patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Half of the study cohort (17) presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (TCS); half (17) presented in generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE). Six patients in GCSE received LEV during their seizures; 2 also received fosphenytoin. One improved immediately following LEV administration, and the remaining 5 had seizure control. Eleven GCSE patients (65%) remained seizure free after LEV therapy. The patients with TCS (17) received LEV after seizure(s) control. Sixteen (94%) were seizure-free during their hospital course. We found no adverse drug effects. In total, 27 of 34 patients (79%) had a return to baseline neurological and physical health. Six had long-term sequelae; none of which are known LEV side-effects. We identified 46 toxic substances and 22 known seizurogenic agents (48%). The median length of stay was 3.7 days (0.4–96), and the median duration of in-hospital LEV therapy was 1.6 days (0–49). Conclusions: Levetiracetam used as a second-line agent was associated with control of drug-induced seizures and prevention of seizure recurrence without obvious adverse effects. A prospective study is needed to confirm these results.

AB  - Lumbar plexopathy is characterized by an abrupt onset of sensory disturbances, weakness, and loss of deep tendon reflexes of lower extremities. The various causes of lumbar plexopathy include trauma, infections, space-occupying lesion, vascular diseases, metabolic diseases, and the use of drugs such as heroin. Postoperative rhabdomyolysis occurs secondary to prolonged muscle compression due to surgical positioning. Herein, we report a case of lumbar plexopathy, complicating an injury to the paraspinal muscle and iliopsoas muscle that occurred in the flexed lateral decubitus position following radical nephrectomy. © the Korean Society of Anesthesiologists, 2012.

AB  - Introduction: We describe a case of an acute overdose in a former professional cyclist with a heavy past of doping and drug addiction. A 31-year-old man was admitted in hospital for generalized tonico-clonic seizures concomitted with hyperthermic syndrome and unstable hemodynamic status. During his transport to the emergency department, he presented two cardio-pulmonary arrests which required an external electric shock and adrenaline administration. History of the disease revealed that the patient was in a context of benzodiazepines withdrawal. During five days, he complained about shivers, sweats, headaches and nausea with change of his general state. Moreover, he might have taken cocaine the night before his admission. Material and methods: During his coverage by emergency service, the body temperature =40 °C, SpO2 =70%, blood pressure =70/40 mm Hg and heart rate =70/mn. Several cardiac, biological and toxicological examinations were implemented during hospitalization. Results: The electrocardiogram highlights conduction abnormalities (slow QT then ventricular extrasystoles). Biological examination revealed a mixt severe acidosis (pH = 7.27, paCO2 = 6.64 kPa, lactates = 5.4 mmol/L), a hypokaliemia (2.2 mmol/L), and an acute kidney failure with creatinin at 169 μmol/L associated with rhabdmyolyse (CPK = 13000U/L). Toxicological research revealed the presence in blood of high concentrations of cocaine and its main metabolite (cocaine concentration = 290 ng/mL, benzoylecgonine concentration = 3000 ng/mL). Moreover, several medicine drugs were also detected in blood sample (tramadol, acetaminophen, lidocain and hydroxyzine). All were in therapeutic concentrations, excepted tramadol which was measured at the concentration of 1880 ng/mL (and 2000 ng/mL for O-DMT, its active metabolite). Discussion/Conclusion: This fatal overdose with a massive cocaine cunsomption associated with a large dose of tramadol presented a mixt adrenergic-serotoninergic syndrom with seizures, hyperthermia, blood pressure fluctuations, acidosis and hypokaliemia and rhabdomyolysis. Let us note that the high concentration of tramadol found in this case, has probably potentiated the toxic effect of cocaine. Interestingly, the main part of the observed toxic symptoms linked to tramadol seems rather in touch with the inhibition of the recapture of monoamine than with the opioid activity leading to mixt adrenergic-serotoninergic syndrom possibly related with the drug-abusing profile of the patient [1].

AB  - Antidepressants are very widely used and associated with traumatic injury, yet little is known about their potential for harmful drug interactions. We aimed to identify potential drug interaction signals by assessing concomitant medications (precipitant drugs) taken with individual antidepressants (object drugs) that were associated with unintentional traumatic injury. We conducted pharmacoepidemiologic screening of 2000–2015 Optum Clinformatics data, identifying drug interaction signals by performing self-controlled case series studies for antidepressant + precipitant pairs and injury. We included persons aged 16–90 years codispensed an antidepressant and ≥ 1 precipitant drug(s), with an injury during antidepressant therapy. We classified antidepressant person-days as either precipitant-exposed or precipitant-unexposed. The outcome was an emergency department or inpatient discharge diagnosis for unintentional traumatic injury. We used conditional Poisson regression to calculate confounder adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and accounted for multiple estimation via semi-Bayes shrinkage. We identified 330,884 new users of antidepressants who experienced an injury. Among such persons, we studied concomitant use of 7,953 antidepressant + precipitant pairs. Two hundred fifty-six (3.2%) pairs were positively associated with injury and deemed potential drug interaction signals; 22 of these signals had adjusted RRs > 2.00. Adjusted RRs ranged from 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.12, P = 0.04) for citalopram + gabapentin to 3.06 (1.42–6.60) for nefazodone + levonorgestrel. Sixty-five (25.4%) signals are currently reported in a seminal drug interaction knowledgebase. We identified numerous new population-based signals of antidepressant drug interactions associated with unintentional traumatic injury. Future studies, intended to test hypotheses, should confirm or refute these potential interactions.

AB  - In the United States, psychoactive prescription medications rank second only to marijuana as drags of abuse (if tobacco and alcohol are discounted). Physician stopping-visiting multiple physicians simply to procure prescriptions-has been a traditional method for acquiring drugs Illicitly. As community-based efforts to curtail physician shopping have expanded, drug abusers have turned increasingly to the internet. Illegal internet pharmacies, increasing rapidly in number during the past decade and requiring neither prescription nor physician oversight, offer minimal interference to obtaining drugs. With no physician involved, patients cease to be patients. Instead, they become consumers sale to buy prescription medications, even controlled substances, from anonymous providers offering no ongoing treatment relationship and taking no responsibility for the drugs dispensed. When complications occur, these consumers become patients, turning back to the traditional medical system to manage overdoses, addictions, and drug adverse effects and interactions. We present a case series illustrating some of the medical problems that resulted from drugs bought on-line illegally.

AB  - Cytochrome P450 enzymes are essential for the metabolism of many medications. Although this class has more than 50 enzymes, six of them metabolize 90 percent of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Genetic variability (polymorphism) in these enzymes may influence a patient's response to commonly prescribed drug classes, including beta blockers and antidepressants. Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be inhibited or induced by drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. Interactions with warfarin, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and statins often involve the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Knowledge of the most important drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as the most potent inhibiting and inducing drugs, can help minimize the possibility of adverse drug reactions and interactions. Although genotype tests can determine if a patient has a specific enzyme polymorphism, it has not been determined if routine use of these tests will improve outcomes.

AB  - Painful diabetic neuropathy affects the quality of life and has no curative therapy. It manifests mainly as burning, pins and needles sensation starting in the feet and progresses upwards. It has established metabolic and vascular pathophysiologic mechanisms. Recent studies try to combine these mechanisms in one big scheme. The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Electrophysiologic studies and skin biopsy plays a supportive role. The physician needs also to exclude other etiologies, commonly encountered in diabetics, such as neuropathies from alcoholism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and uremia among others. Although many screening tests were introduced over the decades, the tuning fork test is still the simplest and widely used. The treatment is multidisciplinary. While tight glycemic control is the main pillar of prevention, drugs are the only proven treatment. Duloxetine and pregabalin are the only FDA approved medications for PDN. Generally, antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the most commonly used. Rational polypharmacy has recently emerged as a necessary way to decrease the effective dose of the prescribed drugs while benefiting from its synergistic outcome. This way we can spare the patient an array of unpleasant side effects. These are the main reason behind medical noncompliance. Lifestyle modifications produce subjective well being. Physical and occupational therapy help patients cope with pain among other benefits. Finally, several authoritative medical associations have published guidelines for therapeutic approach to PDN. It cannot be overemphasized that the approach needs to be individualized. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Case Report: An 18 year old male presented with inability to pass urine. Patient was seen three days prior for a suspected seizure at an outside hospital ER where gastric lavage was perfomed for multidrug overdose. After discharge from the outside ER, the patient noted he was only able to pass a few drops of urine. On arrival, patient's vital signs included: blood pressure of 149/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30, and temperature of 36.6o C. He was awake and alert with a Glasgow coma score of 15. General physical exam yielded no significant findings except for mild right upper quandrant tenderness without guarding. Initially upon discharge from the outside hospital ER, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were 8 mg/dL and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. Current laboratory investigations demonstrated a serum myoglobin greater than 500 mg/dL and CK-MB of 2.5 ng/ml. A urine toxicology was positive for marijuana. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.008, pH of 6.0, protein of 200 mg/dL, moderate hemoglobin and 24 red blood cells. Urine myoglobin was elevated at 32 ng/ml. Serum chemistry demonstrated (mmol/L) a sodium of 131, potassium of 4.2, chloride of 93, bicarbonate of 25, glucose of 87 mg/dL, BUN of 36 md/dL and Cr of 10.8 mg/dL. Renal ultrasound was done and showed presence of normal kidneys. A diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to rhabdomyolysis was established. Patient was admitted to PICU and vigorously hydrated with alkalinized IV fluids. Further history revealed a long-standing abuse of Tramadol. Persistence of AKI required subsequent initiation of hemodialysis resulting in stabilization of kidney function and normalization of urine output. Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture of positive and negative isomers and exerts noradrenergic, opioid and serotoninergic effects. At higher doses, Tramadol has central nervous effects including respiratory depression and seizures. Our patient's case demonstrates the ability of Tramadol abuse to induce profound multisystem injury. Notably, as a nonscheduled medication, statistics on its use and abuse are not monitored by the FDA. Our patient's case demonstrates the need for a high index of suspicion of Tramadol abuse, recognition of its ability to cause multiorgan injury including AKI, and the need for closer surveillance of its use.

AB  - We describe the case of a 4 year old, female neutered greyhound, presented for investigation of thoracolumbar hyperalgesia one week after extreme exertion. MRI of the thoracolumbar spine revealed muscle changes consistent with exertional myopathy. The MRI features of this disease are previously unreported. This dog's exercise was exclusively lead walking, but she escaped and ran for four miles, developing severe pain, unresponsive to carprofen, tramadol and prednisolone, but responsive to gabapentin. Serum creatinine kinase was markedly elevated. The dog was presented to us one week after the incident, and pain was elicited on palpation of the thoracolumbar spine. On MRI, diffuse T2W and STIR signal hyperintensity extended bilaterally over the longissimus and iliocostalis muscles from the T5 to L7 vertebrae. These were mildly hyperintense on T1W and strongly contrast enhancing. Gradient echo images showed no signs suggestive of haemorrhage. The muscles were markedly swollen. No other muscle groups were affected. The changes were consistent with muscle oedema, attributed to exertional myopathy. Myoglobinuria was not present. This dog made a full recovery following 2 weeks of rest and analgesia, and remained normal with a follow-up period of 8 months. Key points from this case are that exercise induced myopathy causes marked, diffuse hyperintensities on T2W and STIR images, with strong contrast enhancement. In cases with focal pathology and without myoglobinuria, an excellent outcome can be achieved with medicalmanagement.

AB  - Introduction: An opioid overdose crisis is currently ongoing in the North-American continent in relation to the misuse of opioid analgesics and the spread of new fentanyloids on the recreational scene. Data regarding the opioid overdoses in France remain scarce. Our objectives were to describe the opioid overdoses admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and characterize the involved compounds, the consequent clinical features, the resulting complications and the patient management. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective single-centre observational study including all patients admitted in the ICU during a 10 year period (2008-2018) for an oipioid overdose evidenced by the typical opioid toxidrom (coma, pinpoint pupils and bradypnea) associated to a compatible blood and urine toxicological screening. Results: In 10 years, 231 patients (147 males and 84 females + age, 38 years (33-46) [median (percentiles 25-75)]) were admitted for opioid intoxication in the ICU. The patients presented consciousness impairment [Glasgow coma score of 6 (3-10)], respiratory rate of 11 min (8-15) and pinpoint myosis (90%). Naloxone (64%) and flumazenil (20%) were administered to avoid tracheal intubation + but mechanical ventilation was requested in 36% of the patients [duration-20 h (11-72)]. Duration of ICU stay was 41 h (24-72). The observed complications included aspiration pneumonia (35%), rhabdomyolysis (26%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (13%), cardiovascular failure (11%), withdrawal syndrome (8%), hospital-acquired infection (4%) and death (1%). Toxicity was related to opioid misuse (52%) versus opioid overdose (48%). Multidrug exposure was found in 100% of the cases and the involved opioids as follows-morphine (44%), heroin (32%), buprenorphine (30%), methadone (26%), codeine (24%), tramadol (6%), d-propoxyphene (6%), fentanyl (1%) and oxycodone (0.5%). Prevalence of the different opioids was mainly influenced by the banning of propoxyphene from the market in 2011 and the consecutive increase in tramadol prescriptions. Conclusion: Our large cohort of opioid poisonings clearly supports the risks of life-threatening consequences in case of misuse or overdose. Mixed opioid use and combination to other legal and illegal drugs are frequent supporting the role of drug-drug interactions in the onset of toxicity in these multidrug poisonings.

AB  - Opioids, both endogenous and exogenous, have a strong influence on the renal function through different mechanisms, producing changes in the renal excretion of water and sodium. Several studies have demonstrated that opioids influence renal function, according to the agonist profile used. Mu, kappa, and delta agonists produce different renal effects, although the mechanisms remain unclear. Experimental data have given the input for a possible therapeutic role of kappa agonists for some specific conditions, for example, in treating water retention or hyponatremia occurring in patients who have hepatic cirrhosis with ascites. On the other hand, changes in renal function might strongly condition the use of opioids in the clinical setting, and the knowledge of the relationship between opioids and renal function is mandatory for a tailored approach to accommodate the individual responses in terms of pain intensity, tolerance, and adverse effects experienced by these groups of patients. The influence of renal function when using different opioids in the clinical setting is reviewed, as well as problems related to transplantation, renal damage induced by opioid addiction, and problems related to the use of opioid antagonists in such conditions. Perspective: Endogenous opioids exert physiologic effects on renal function, and the use of opioids may have an influence on renal activity. Renal impairment has a serious impact on the clearance of most opioids used in the clinical setting. Biochemical and clinical monitoring is mandatory to prevent serious complications. © 2004 by the American Pain Society.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires extra attention for immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients. We report on a case of a 35-year-old renal transplant recipient who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy. With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Renal toxicity has been described with tramadol overdoses; however, it is typically associated with rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure and/or mortality. Our patient was a 16-year-old female who was evaluated following an intentional tramadol ingestion, estimated 27.8 to 37 mg/kg, and had a seizure prior to arriving at our health care facility. Her symptoms were consistent with a tramadol ingestion; however, she developed transient acute renal impairment (peak serum creatinine, 4.04 mg/dL), which improved over 6 days with minimal intervention. No other causes were identified to explain her acute renal impairment thus it was attributed to the tramadol overdose. Providers should be aware that transient acute renal impairment could occur with an intentional tramadol ingestion and may not require aggressive intervention.

AB  - Statins are widely prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. While their efficacy in the secondary prevention of vascular events is proven, their safety profile in older patients with multiple co-morbidities and polypharmacy remains questionable. Although rare, antihydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (anti-HMGCR) myopathy is a severe adverse effect of statins, manifesting as myalgias, proximal muscle weakness, muscle cell necrosis and rhabdomyolysis. We report an uncommon case of an autopsy-proven anti-HMGCR necrotising myopathy predominately affecting pharyngeal muscles in an older patient, leading to dysphagia, pneumonia and death within 3 weeks from onset. Clinicians should screen for dysphagia in any patient with suspected anti-HMGCR myopathy, order an anti-HMGCR antibody titre and consider prompt immunosupressive therapy.

AB  - Objectives To study the association between accidental opioid overdose and neurological, respiratory, cardiac and other serious adverse events and whether risk of these adverse events was elevated during hospital readmissions compared with initial admissions. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Population-based study using linked administrative data in British Columbia, Canada. Participants The primary analysis included 2433 patients with 2554 admissions for accidental opioid overdose between 2006 and 2015, including 121 readmissions within 1 year of initial admission. The secondary analysis included 538 patients discharged following a total of 552 accidental opioid overdose hospitalizations and 11 040 matched controls from a cohort of patients with ≥180 days of prescription opioid use. Outcome measures The primary outcome was encephalopathy; secondary outcomes were adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, pulmonary haemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure, rhabdomyolysis, paraplegia or tetraplegia, acute renal failure, death, a composite outcome of encephalopathy or any secondary outcome and total serious adverse events (all-cause hospitalisation or death). We analysed these outcomes using generalised linear models with a logistic link function. Results 3% of accidental opioid overdose admissions included encephalopathy and 25% included one or more adverse events (composite outcome). We found no evidence of increased risk of encephalopathy (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.49) or other outcomes during readmissions versus initial admissions. In the secondary analysis, <5 patients in each cohort experienced encephalopathy. Risk of the composite outcome (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.12) and all-cause mortality (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.86) were higher for patients in the year following overdose relative to controls. Conclusions We found no evidence that risk of encephalopathy or other adverse events was higher in readmissions compared with initial admissions for accidental opioid overdose. Risk of serious morbidity and mortality may be elevated in the year following an accidental opioid overdose.

AB  - Background: Serotonin toxicity is a common cause of drug-induced altered mental status. However, there are no large case series evaluating the causes of serotonin toxicity, describing the symptomatology, or rate of treatment with antidotal therapy Research question: What are the patient characteristics and xenobiotics associated with the development of serotonin toxicity? Methods: This study evaluated cases of serotonin toxicity in the ToxIC registry, a national database of prospectively collected cases seen at the bedside by medical toxicologists from > 50 geographically diverse sites that contains over 50,000 cases. The database was searched for 'serotonin syndrome" between 1/1/2010-12/31/2016. Cases were excluded if multiple toxidromes were listed or if marked as "unlikely tox related" or "unknown if tox related." Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographics, signs/symptoms, outcomes, and associated xenobiotics. Results: Included were 1010 cases. Females made up 608 cases (60%). Ages: <2 (3,0.3%), 2-6 (8, 0.8%), 7-12 (9,0.9%), 13-18 (278,27.3%), 19-65 (682, 67%), and >66 (35, 3.4%). Reasons for encounter: drug abuse (53, 5%), intentional (789, 78%), adverse drug event (95, 9%), and unintentional (66, 6%). Signs and symptoms: hyperreflexia/clonus/myoclonus (601, 60%), agitation (337, 33%), tachycardia [HR> 140 bpm] (256, 25%), rigidity (140, 14%), seizures (139, 14%), hypertension [SBP > 200 mmHg; DBP >120 mmHg] (71, 7%), and hyperthermia [T> 105 F] (29, 3%). Complications: rhabdomyolysis (97, 10%), ventricular dysrhythmias (8, 0.8%), and death (1, 0.1%). Treatments: benzodiazepines 67% (677/1010) and cyproheptadine 15%(153/1010). One hundred ninety-two different xenobiotics were reported with 2046 total exposures. Antidepressants as a class were most commonly the "primary agent" listed (915, 45%) with bupropion the most frequent overall (147, 7.2%). Common non-antidepressants were dextromethorphan (95, 6.9%), lamotrigine (64, 3.1%), and tramadol (60, 2.9%). Discussion: In this series, serotonin toxicity most often occurred in adult patients with intentional overdose. Antidepressants were most often listed as the primary agents of toxicity. Interestingly, bupropion, a norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor, was the most frequently mentioned xenobiot-ic. Benzodiazepines were commonly administered. Though often cited as a potential antidote, only 15% of patients received cyproheptadine. Severe toxicity was rare. Only a single death was reported.

AB  - Background Serotonin toxicity is a common cause of drug-induced altered mental status. However, data on the causes of serotonin toxicity, symptomatology, complications, and rate of antidotal treatment are limited. Methods This study evaluated cases of serotonin toxicity in the ToxIC registry, an international database of prospectively collected cases seen by medical toxicologists. Serotonin toxicity was diagnosed by bedside evaluation of medical toxicology specialists and explicit criteria were not used. The database was searched for "serotonin syndrome" between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Results There were 1010 cases included. Females made up 608 (60%) cases. Ages are as follows: younger than 2 years (3, 0.3%), 2 to 6 years (8, 0.8%), 7 to 12 years (9, 0.9%), 13 to 18 years (276, 27.3%), 19 to 65 years (675, 67%), older than 66 years (33, 3.4%), unknown (6, 0.6%). Reasons for encounter: intentional (768, 76%), adverse drug event/reaction (127, 12.6%), unintentional (66, 6%), and unknown (55, 5.4%).

AB  - Aims: As an analgesic that acts upon the central nervous system (CNS), tramadol has gained popularity in treating moderate to severe pain. Recently, it has been increasingly reported as a drug of misuse with intentional overdoses or intoxications. This review focuses on tramadol intoxication in humans and its effects on different systems. Subject and method: This narrative review provides a comprehensive view of the pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, and incidence of tramadol toxicity with an in-depth look at its side effects. In addition, the main approaches to the management of tramadol poisoning are described. Results: Tramadol poisoning can affect multiple organ systems: gastrointestinal, central nervous system (seizure, CNS depression, low-grade coma, anxiety, and over time anoxic brain damage), cardiovascular system (palpitation, mild hypertension to life-threatening complications such as cardiopulmonary arrest), respiratory system, renal system (renal failure with higher doses of tramadol intoxication), musculoskeletal system (rhabdomyolysis), endocrine system (hypoglycemia), as well as, cause serotonin syndrome. Seizure, a serious nervous disturbance, is more common in tramadol intoxication than with other opioids. Fatal tramadol intoxications are uncommon, except in ingestion cases concurrent with other medications, particularly CNS depressants, most commonly benzodiazepines, and ethanol. Conclusion: With the increasing popularity of tramadol, physicians must be aware of its adverse effects, substantial abuse potential, and drug interactions, to weigh its risk–benefit ratio for pain management. Alternative therapies might be considered in patients with a previous overdose history to reduce risks for adverse outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the triad of mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular changes. We report a case of serotonin syndrome masquerading as disease flare in a lupus nephritis patient with end-stage renal disease receiving linezolid for the treatment of infected pseudoaneurysm. Case report: A 36-year-old female lupus nephritis patient on maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease had been on multiple antibiotics, including anti-tuberculosis medications, over the past month for infected pseudoaneurysm complicating her arteriovenous fistula. Due to minimal response, she underwent pseudoaneurysmal ligation and given linezolid. Two days later, she developed chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, tremors, later accompanied by high-grade fever, diarrhea, insomnia, and body weakness. Although fully awake and oriented, she was markedly agitated, mildly icteric, had hyperreflexia and asthenia with proximal muscle strength graded 3/5 in all extremities. Blood counts revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia; ancillary tests showed aspartate aminotransferase markedly higher than alanine aminotransferase, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase, and low C3 levels. Intravenous hydrocortisone was started for a suspected lupus flare. On the background of linezolid, isoniazid, and tramadol administration, serotonin syndrome with rhabdomyolysis was strongly considered. Offending drugs were discontinued, resulting in the dramatic improvement of symptoms and improved strength and well-being. The steroid was successfully tapered to 5 mg/day and a week later, she remained afebrile without recurrence of symptoms. Conclusion: Serotonin syndrome should be considered in patients on multiple serotonergic agents on the background of end-stage renal disease. Prompt recognition and distinction from lupus activity can significantly impact management decisions.

AB  - Rhabdomyolysis is a rare and complex condition that involves injury of the skeletal muscle fibres, resulting in the release of substances such as creatine kinase and myoglobin. It is associated with acute kidney injury and mortality. This article describes the case of a 40-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after an overdose of tramadol hydrochloride. It uses critical reflection to explore traumatic and non-traumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis and reviews the literature relating to the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis through laboratory and point-of-care testing. To ensure the timely identification of patients at risk of deterioration, emergency nurses need to be aware of the potential causes and the clinical signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: - Recognize the clinical features of serotonin Syndrome LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: - Manage serotonin syndrome CASE: A 53 year old male who had been previously seen at two medical facilities was transferred due to findings of fever, tachycardia, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with bandemia and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Preliminary diagnoses from the referring facilities included sepsis and rhabdomyolysis. Prior to transfer he was started on IV fluids and given a 2 mg dose of IV lorazepam for agitation. History revealed anxiety, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis and a mild nonproductive cough. On careful review of his outpatient medications, it was observed that he was simultaneously taking three serotonergic agents: bupropion, citalopram and tramadol. On initial assessment of vital signs he was febrile, tachycardic and had a blood pressure of 104/68. Physical examination revealed resting tremors and hyperreflexia predominant in the lower extremities. Initial lab data revealed a WBC of 16.7 with 19% bands and a CPK of 1496. Investigative procedures revealed no demonstrable foci of infection. Urine drug screen was negative. Serotonergic agents were held at the time of admission and IV fluids were continued. The patient was placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and treated symptomatically with IV lorazepam for tremor and agitation. Symptom resolution, including cessation of tremor and agitation, occurred quickly in less than 24 hours and was accompanied by normalization of white blood cell count and significant decrease in CPK level. DISCUSSION: It has been reported that over 85% of physicians are unaware of serotonin syndrome as a clinical diagnosis. This case illustrates how easily it may be misdiagnosed and highlights the importance of taking a detailed history including the use of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and illicit substances along with performing a thorough physical examination. Serotonin syndrome commonly presents as a triad of mental status changes (agitation, restlessness, delirium, disorientation), autonomic dysfunction (diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyperthermia, BP instability, vomitting, diarrhea) and neurologic abnormalities (tremor, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, muscle rigidity, bilateral Babinski sign). The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. Serum serotonin concentrations don't correlate with clinical findings and no lab tests confirm the diagnosis. Nevertheless it can be associated with some non-specific lab findings namely: leukocytosis, elevated CPK, transaminitis, metabolic acidosis and these can be used to monitor for potential complications. The Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules represent the most accurate diagnostic criteria for it. To fulfill the Hunter Criteria a patient must have taken a serotonergic agent and have ONE of the following: spontaneous clonus, inducible clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis, ocular clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis, tremor and hyperreflexia, hypertonia, temperature above 38°C plus ocular clonus or inducible clonus. In mild cases, discontinuation of inciting medications, supportive care, and sedation with benzodiazepines is generally sufficient. Moderately ill patients require more aggressive treatment of autonomic instability and possibly treatment with a serotonin antagonist (cyproheptadine). Hyperthermic patients are critically ill and often require paralysis and endotracheal intubation.

AB  - Case: Shakuyakukanzoto (SKT) has long been used for the treatment of muscle cramps. A typical and well-known adverse effect of SKT is licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism with symptoms of hypokalemia and hypertension. Outcome: Herein, we report two cases of severe hypokalemia due to SKT-induced pseudoaldosteronism. Both patients were female, over 80 years old and with a history of prolonged SKT usage. Symptoms related to pseudoaldosteronism resolved soon after SKT stoppage with spironolactone. Conclusion: SKT-induced pseudoaldosteronism should be considered in elderly patients with hypokalemia and hypertension.

AB  - We are presenting the case of a 38-year-old woman with nonverbal autism and intellectual disability, hospitalized in a neurobehavioural unit because of a pica behaviour for 3 years. During the hospitalization, the patient presented an episode of pain, agitation, restlessness, rhabdomyolysis, coma, tachycardia, hyperthermia, shivering, and diarrhoea. The main hypothesis raised was tramadol overdose because of the immediate antidote response to the injection of naloxone 0,4 mg/mL. Even if we did not exceed the recommended prescription dosage of tramadol, the presence of gastric bezoar slowed the absorption of the drug, and the consequence was an opioid overdose and serotonin syndrome.

AB  - Background: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is becoming a more frequent diagnosis in the intensive care unit (ICU). We sought to determine the clinical presentation, drug exposures, and outcomes of SS in critically ill patients. Methods: A retrospective study of 33 consecutive ICU patients with SS between March 2007 and March 2012 in ICUs in a large teaching hospital. SS was defined using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria. Results: Seventeen patients (52 %) were admitted for mental status changes, including seven patients (21 %) with drug overdose and four cases (12 %) in which SS was considered the primary admission diagnosis. In 13 patients (39 %) the features of SS developed only after a mean of 6.8 ± 9 days of hospitalization. Most received multiple serotonergic drugs upon diagnosis (median three drugs, range 1-5). Antidepressants were the serotonergic medications most often used before admission, and opioids (principally fentanyl) and antiemetics were the most frequently prescribed new serotonin-enhancing medications. Altered mental status was present in all patients and myoclonus, rigidity, and hyperreflexia were the most prevalent examination signs. All but one patient had documented recovery. The mean time to neurological improvement was 56 ± 5 h, but ranged from 8 to 288 h. There were no cases of renal failure related to rhabdomyolysis, or death or persistent disability caused by SS. Conclusion: SS in the ICU occurs most often because of exposure to multiple serotonergic agents. Continuation of antidepressants plus the addition of opioids and antiemetics during hospitalization are most commonly responsible for this complication. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - We report a 21-year-old man with bipolar disorder who was on a stable dose of escitalopram and risperidone. Tramadol and cough syrup (dextromethorphan) were added for his recent attack of upper respiratory tract infection. However, he developed various neurological symptoms. Haloperidol and ondansetron were added after hospitalisation. However, his condition deteriorated. A diagnosis of serotonin syndrome (SS) was made, and cyproheptadine was started. Cyproheptadine provided relief in most of the symptoms within 48 hours except for the presence of fever and rigidity. The addition of bromocriptine provided a complete resolution of the symptoms. We considered the presence of both SS and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in this case. There are four similar cases in the literature. We discussed a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for patients who are on both serotonergic agents and neuroleptics and develop SS-like or NMS-like clinical features.

AB  - Introduction: Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a drug-induced potentially life-threatening clinical condition. There is a paucity of data on the risk factors, clinical course, and complications associated with fatal SS. Objective: To characterize the epidemiological profile, clinical features, and risk factors associated with fatal SS through a systematic review. Methods: We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Google Scholar for case reports, case series, or cohort studies of fatal SS. Results: Initial database search identified 2326 articles of which 46 (56 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean age was 42.3 years (range 18–87 years) with female predominance (57%). North America and Europe constitute 80% of the reported fatal SS. The symptoms evolved very rapidly, within 24 h after the administration of serotonergic drugs in 59% of the cases. Fever (61%) was the most common symptom, followed by seizure (36%) and tremors (30%). The mean temperature in the reported cases (25 patients) was 41.6 ± 1.3 °C (range 38.3–43.5 °C). SS was reported to occur with the maintenance dosage of serotonergic agents, after initiation of the drug for the first time, and addition of the drugs for the development of another unrelated illness. Creatine kinase (CK) activities were elevated (>3 times of the upper limit of normal) in eighteen patients, and it was very high (>25,000 IU/L) in four patients. Presence of high grade fever, seizures, and high CK activities may be associated with severe SS. Nine patients (16%) received 5-HT2A antagonists as a therapy. About 50% of patients died within 24 h of the onset of symptoms. Conclusions: While fatal SS is rare, frequently observed features include hyperthermia, seizures, and high CK activities. Cyproheptadine use appears infrequent for these patients.

AB  - Purpose: Due to polypharmacy and the rising popularity of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), oncology patients are particularly at risk of drug–drug interactions (DDI) or herb–drug interactions (HDI). The aims of this study were to assess DDI and HDI in outpatients taking oral anticancer drug. Method: All prescribed and non-prescribed medications, including CAM, were prospectively collected by hospital pharmacists during a structured interview with the patient. DDI and HDI were analyzed using four interaction software programs: Thériaque®, Drugs.com®, Hédrine, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) database. All detected interactions were characterized by severity, risk and action mechanism. The need for pharmaceutical intervention to modify drug use was determined on a case-by-case basis. Results: 294 patients were included, with a mean age of 67 years [55–79]. The median number of chronic drugs per patient was 8 [1–29] and 55% of patients used at least one CAM. At least 1 interaction was found for 267 patients (90.8%): 263 (89.4%) with DDI, 68 (23.1%) with HDI, and 64 (21.7%) with both DDI and HDI. Only 13% of the DDI were found in Thériaque® and Drugs.com® databases, and 125 (2.5%) were reported with similar level of risk on both databases. 104 HDI were identified with only 9.5% of the interactions found in both databases. 103 pharmaceutical interventions were performed, involving 61 patients (20.7%). Conclusion: Potentially clinically relevant drug interaction were frequently identified in this study, showing that several databases and structured screening are required to detect more interactions and optimize medication safety. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting alpha 2 adrenergic agonist approved by the FDA for sedation in ICU patients for 24 hours and for procedural sedation. There is evidence supporting its use in reducing opioid consumption (1, 2), as an adjunct in regional anesthesia (3) and preventing emergence delirium (4). We report the use of dexmedetomidine for the management of acute post-operative pain. Clinical Features: A 35-year-old male presented with a compound crush injury to his right leg after an allterrain- vehicle accident. He was admitted to the monitored trauma unit and remained hemodynamically stable off circulatory or ventilator support. The extensive limb injury was complicated by wound infection, sepsis and rhabdomyolysis. He required subsequent multiple operations for debridement of devitalized tissue and eventual amputation of the limb. His pain was initially managed by the Acute Pain Service (APS) with hydromorphone (HM) intravenous (IV) patient controlled analgesia (IVPCA) pump and oral multimodal analgesia protocol of acetaminophen, celecoxib, tramadol and pregabalin. Over the next 10 days (and through 5 surgeries), his pain scores and opioid requirements had increased considerably. Despite maximal multimodal analgesic use and increased PCA settings, his daily opioid requirements reached an oral morphine equivalent of 1000mg. His PCA had been changed to a hydromorphone- ketamine combination. By the 13th day, he had suffered recurrent pain crises with acute neuropathic symptomsexcruciating, burning and shooting pain. Despite maximal use of his PCA, his pain was reported as uncontrolled and was associated with extreme distress and agitation. The APS initiated a lidocaine infusion, but this was not well tolerated. In the Trauma Unit under continuous monitoring, the APS gave him a 1mcg/kg bolus of dexmedtomidine. This was well tolerated and he reported a reduction in his pain. An infusion of dexmedtomidine was initiated (0.2 mcg/kg/hr) and the patient remained stable and comfortable. This continued intermittently for 3 days and his pain scores and opioid requirements reduced gradually. The dexmedtomidine infusion was discontinued and he was weaned off his PCA. He remained on oral multimodal analgesia till his discharge to the rehabilitation institution. Conclusion: This patient's pain management reports our first experience with dexmedtomidine infusions for the management of severe post-operative acute pain. This has not been previously reported. Further investigation is needed to explore this opioid sparing, anti-nociceptive role of dexmedtomidine in patients with severe injuries, acute hyperalgesia and difficult to treat acute pain.

AB  - Lower lumbar paraspinal muscles constitute a compartment as they are surrounded by distinct fascial and bony boundaries. Lumbar paraspinal compartment syndrome is a rare entity, often caused by intense exercise, but also can be a postoperative complication. We present a 60-year-old man with low back pain, numbness in the left lower back and radicular pain in the left lower extremity, which started after a surgery that involved prolonged positioning on the left side 7 years before, and persisted to the day of evaluation. There was an immediate transient rise in the creatine kinase after surgery. Electromyography showed a left lower lumbar-sacral plexopathy and a lumbar spine MRI revealed fatty infiltration of the lower lumbar-sacral paraspinal muscles. The emergence of radicular lower limb pain was likely due to the compression of the proximal portion of lumbar-sacral plexus during the acute stage of rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Background and objectives: Many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients present pain. The administration of analgesics and sedatives is crucial for patient comfort and to reduce stress, as well as to prevent delay in recovery and ventilator weaning. The objective of the present study was to conduct a review on analgesia and sedation in the ICU. Content: The present study reviewed the causes of pain, the methods used to evaluate the intensity of pain and sedation and the conducts employed in pain treatment and sedation. Drug selection is important in order to prevent excessive sedation, by performing analgesia before the sedation. Conclusions: The most commonly employed drugs are morphine, fentanyl, midazolam and propofol. Other medications are less frequently used. ©Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the most common potential clinically significant drug-drug unteractions (DDIs) in prescribed pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting in Croatia. Twelve community pharmacies were randomly selected in this research. Retrospective pharmacotherapy record data analysis was conducted on consecutive eligible patients. Potential DDIs were detected using Lexicomp software that categorizes DDIs according to clinical significance. Categories C (monitor drug therapy), D (consider therapy modification) and X (avoid combination) are of clinical concern. In total, 1211 patients were enrolled in this study. The results showed that 84% of patients had at least one clinically significant interaction. The average number of interactions per patient was 4. Overall, 4798 potentially clinically significant DDIs were identified; 3945 (82.2%) required therapy monitoring, while other interactions (D and X category) required specific therapy modification. According to the level of clinical significance the most common clinical consequences of identified potential drug interactions were increased risk of hypotension, impaired renal function, central nervous system depression, gastrointestinal toxicity and QTc prolongation. Research indicates the high exposure to potential clinically significant DDIs in the prescribed pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting and imposes the need for standardised models of pharmacist interventions.

AB  - Sedation and analgesia constitute a fundamental part of the daily clinical practice in intensive care units (ICUs). Its use is necessary to provide comfort, pain relief, anxiolysis, and amnesia to patients subjected to distressing procedures such as mechanical ventilation. It has been demonstrated that adequate sedoanalgesia lessens stress-related events in the critically ill patients, facilitating their management and improving their outcomes. However, misuse of sedatives and analgesics may carry the risk of unrecognized enduring deleterious immediate and long-term consequences such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital time, and psychological distress. For these reasons, a number of sedation and analgesia strategies have been proposed to provide the minimal effective dose during the shortest possible time to avoid the adverse effects derived from agent accumulation.Patient-targeted sedation protocols, analgesia-based sedation strategies, and several interventions such as daily interruption or sequential use of sedatives have been proven to optimize patient comfort whereas minimizing awakening time or mechanical ventilator duration and maximizing patient awareness of their surroundings.However, despite the proven beneficial effects of these strategies, their implementation continues to be a challenge to the ICU professionals. Sedation and analgesia strategies should be designed to meet the particular physical and human characteristics of the area where it is to be implemented. Similarly, their implementation should be carried out by multidisciplinary teams that focus on the specific characteristics and circumstances of the patient.

AB  - Purpose: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) may potentially improve prescribing quality, but are subject to poor user acceptance. Reasons for alert overriding have been identified and counterstrategies have been suggested; however, poor alert specificity, a prominent reason of alert overriding, has not been well addressed. This paper aims at structuring modulators that determine alert specificity and estimating their quantitative impact on alert burden. Methods: We developed and summarized optimizing strategies to guarantee the specificity of alerts and applied them to a set of 100 critical and frequent drug interaction (DDI) alerts. Hence, DDI alerts were classified as dynamic, i.e. potentially sensitive to prescription-, co-medication-, or patient-related factors that would change alert severity or render the alert inappropriate compared to static, i.e. always applicable alerts not modulated by cofactors. Results: Within the subset of 100 critical DDI alerts, only 10 alerts were considered as static and for 7 alerts, relevant factors are not generally available in today's patient charts or their consideration would not impact alert severity. The vast majority, i.e. 83 alerts, might require a decrease in alert severity due to factors related to the prescription (N= 13), the co-medication (N= 11), individual patient data (N= 36), or combinations of them (N= 23). Patient-related factors consisted mainly of three lab values, i.e. renal function, potassium, and therapeutic drug monitoring results. Conclusion: This paper outlines how promising the refinement of knowledge bases is in order to increase specificity and decrease alert burden and suggests how to structure knowledge bases to refine DDI alerting. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This prospective observational study examined the severity, type and frequency of potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) in prescriptions dispensed in the hospital pharmacies of M.S. Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and M.S. Ramaiah Hospital, Bangalore, Karnataka. A total of 500 prescriptions were collected over a period of 5 months. PDDIs were identified and analysed using Micromedex database. The frequency of PDDIs was 71.8%, with at least one interacting combination with major (14.20%), moderate (72.70%) and minor (13.09%) interactions. Out of the total PDDIs identified, 60% were pharmacodynamic interactions, 38% were pharmacokinetic interactions and 2% had interaction of unknown mechanism. The largest number of active drugs prescribed with major PDDIs were related to the cardiovascular system (32.63%), central nervous system (22.28%), gastrointestinal tract and drug metabolism (13.37%).The results of the present study showed a high frequency of PDDIs in prescriptions received at hospital pharmacies.

AB  - Background: 3-Methoxy-phencyclidine (3-Meo-PCP) is a novel arylcyclohexamine analogue, which was first described in the 1970s. Reports of recreational use only arose in 2011. Arylcyclohexamines were originally designed for anesthetic use but are often used recreationally. 3- Meo-PCP has three times greater affinity for the NMDA receptor than PCP, but reports on its clinical effects are limited. Methods: A 24-year-old transgender woman presented ten times over 7 months to the emergency department. On four occasions, she had a urine drug screen positive for PCP later identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to have been triggered by the use of 3-MeO-PCP. She admitted to using 'PCP,' reporting use of between 25 and 50 mg by mouth daily. Results: In three out of the four visits, the patient presented comatose requiring intubation for respiratory failure once. Tachycardia (113- 115 bpm) and systolic hypertension (144-160 mmHg) were seen on three visits. The patient developed mild rhabdomyolysis (CK, 5356 IU/L) on one presentation where 3-MeO-PCP was the sole ingestion. She improved over the course of 24 h on all occasions. Absence or presence of nystagmus was not always documented. Co-ingestions present on three occasions included N-ethyl-4-fluoroamphetamine, tramadol, and ethanol. Discussion:A case series of isolated 3-Meo-PCP intoxications from 2015 reported tachycardia, hypertension, nystagmus, and altered mental status as the most common symptoms, which is consistent with this patient's presentations. The one episode of moderate coma with respiratory failure requiring intubation appeared to be an isolated overdose given a negative ethanol level and only detection of the patient's home medications on urine GC/MS. Conclusion: 3-MeO-PCP is a recreational illicit drug rarely encountered in the USA. We present a case series of 3-MeO-PCP ingestions in a single patient associated with clinically significant toxicity illustrating the potential for severe effects.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and pharmacogenetic tests play a major role in minimising adverse drug reactions and enhancing optimal therapeutic response. The response to medication varies greatly between individuals, according to genetic constitution, age, sex, co-morbidities, environmental factors including diet and lifestyle (e.g. smoking and alcohol intake), and drug-related factors such as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions. Most adverse drug reactions are type A reactions, i.e. plasma-level dependent, and represent one of the major causes of hospitalisation, in some cases leading to death. However, they may be avoidable to some extent if pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic factors are taken into consideration. This article provides a review of the literature and describes how to apply and interpret TDM and certain pharmacogenetic tests and is illustrated by case reports. An algorithm on the use of TDM and pharmacogenetic tests to help characterise adverse drug reactions is also presented. Although, in the scientific community, differences in drug response are increasingly recognised, there is an urgent need to translate this knowledge into clinical recommendations. Databases on drug-drug interactions and the impact of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms and adverse drug reaction information systems will be helpful to guide clinicians in individualised treatment choices. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

AB  - The differential diagnosis and empiric management of altered mental status and seizures often overlap. Altered mental status may accompany seizures or simply be the manifestation of a postictal state. This article provides an overview of the numerous causes of altered mental status and seizures: metabolic, toxic, malignant, infectious, and endocrine causes. The article focuses on those agents that should prompt the emergency physician to initiate unique therapy to abate the seizure and correct the underlying cause. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Platelet count is a readily available biomarker predicting disease severity and risk of mortality in the intensive care units (ICU). This study aims to describe the frequency, to assess the risk factors, and to evaluate the impact of thrombocytopenia on patient outcomes in a Toxicological ICU (TICU). Methods: In this prospective observational Cohort study, we enrolled 184 patients admitted to our TICU from October 1st, 2019, to August 23rd, 2020. Mild/moderate and severe thrombocytopenia were defined as at least one platelet counts less than 150×103/µL and 50×103/µL during the ICU stay, respectively. Results: Of 184 enrolled patients, 45.7% had mild to moderate thrombocytopenia and 5.4% had severe thrombocytopenia. Old age (OR: 1.042, 95%CI: 1.01-1.075, P=0.01), male gender (OR: 4.348, 95%CI: 1.33-14.22, P=0.015), increased international normalized ratio (INR) levels (OR: 3.72, 95%CI: 1.15-112, P=0.028), and administration of some medications including heparin (OR: 3.553, 95%CI: 1.11-11.36, P=0.033), antihypertensive drugs (OR: 2.841, 95%CI: 1.081-7.471, P=0.034), linezolid (OR: 13.46, 95%CI: 4.75-38.13, P<0.001), erythromycin (OR: 19.58, 95%CI: 3.23-118.86, P=0.001), and colistin (OR: 10.29, 95% CI 1.44-73.69, P=0.02) were the risk factors of hospital-acquired thrombocytopenia. The outcomes of patients with normal platelet count were significantly better than those who developed thrombocytopenia (P<0.001). Conclusion: We found that thrombocytopenia could develop in almost 50% of patients admitted to TICU, which is associated with poor prognosis. Additionally, the platelet counts should be closely monitored to administer some medications (heparin, antihypertensive drug, and linezolid), especially in old patients.

AB  - Introduction: Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but fatal complication of bariatric surgery. It is characterized by skeletal muscle necrosis with release of muscle enzymes into the circulation. We presented a case that developed postoperative rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury and neuropathy after robotic sleeve gastrectomy. Method: A 33 year-old woman with BMI 72 kg/m2 underwent robotic sleeve gastrectomy. Diabetes and high blood pressure were the associated illnesses. Patient was positioned on the operation table with the legs placed on stirrups with pads. Results: Sleeve gastrectomy procedure was completed without any intraoperative unexpected event. The patient was hemodynamically stable perioperatively. Duration of surgery was 7 hours. She was complaining of severe pain on lower legs postoperatively. Amount of urine was low despite sufficient fluid administration and its color was reddish-brown. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) was 81650 U/L. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and hepatic transaminases were elevated. Aggressive fluid replacement and diuretics were initiated with the diagnoses rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. BUN and creatinine levels decreased to normal in one week and CK level in several weeks. Findings of neuropathy were present on both lower extremities. Mobilization of the patient was delayed because of pain and weakness. Tramadol, duloxetine, pregabalin were given and physical therapy program initiated. The patient could walk without support two months after the operation. Conclusion: Mortality rates of rhabdomyolysis may decrease by early diagnosis. Padding pressure points during surgery, positional changes and reducing operative time are preventive measures. Routine CK level monitoring for bariatric surgery patients is proposed.

AB  - Evidence of nonopioid analgesic effectiveness exceeds that for long-term opioids in chronic noncancer pain (CNCP), most with lower risk. Non-drug therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and physical activation are safer and also effective. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are useful for inflammatory and nociceptive pain, share renal and variable gastrointestinal, bleeding and cardiovascular side effects. Antidepressants with noradrenergic activity (such as tricyclics and seroton-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) and neuromodulating anticonvulsant drugs (gabapentinoids and sodium-channel blockers) are proven to be effective for neuropathic and centralized pain. Ketamine and cannabinoids are other studied analgesics but have a less well-proven role in CNCP.

AB  - Background: Statins may prevent recurrent ischemic events after ischemic stroke. Determining which statin to use remains controversial. We aimed to summarize the evidence for the use of statins in secondary prevention for patients with ischemic stroke by comparing benefits and harms of various statins. Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing statins in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to July 2017. Two authors extracted data and appraised risks of bias. We performed pairwise meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) to compare statins versus placebo/no statin, and network meta-analyses using frequentist random-effects models to compare statins through indirect evidence. We used GRADE to rate the overall certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and all strokes. Secondary outcomes were different types of strokes, cardiovascular events, and adverse events. Results: We identified nine trials (10,741 patients). No head-to-head RCTs were found. The median follow-up period was 2.5 years. Statins did not seem to modify all stroke and all-cause mortality outcomes; they were associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio, OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.93]; absolute risk difference, ARD, - 1.6% [95% CI, - 2.6 to - 0.6%]), ischemic stroke or TIA (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.87]; ARD, - 4.2% [95% CI, - 6.2 to - 2.1%]), and cardiovascular event (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.83]; ARD, - 5.4% [95% CI, - 6.8 to - 3.6%]), and did not seem to modify rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, or rise in creatine kinase. In the comparison of different statins, moderate- to high-quality evidence indicated that differences between pharmaceutical products seemed modest, with high doses (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg/day and simvastatin 40 mg/day) associated with the greatest benefits. TSA excluded random error as a cause of the findings for ischemic stroke and cardiovascular event outcomes. Evidence for increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke was sensitive to the exclusion of the SPARCL trial. Conclusions: Evidence strongly suggests that statins are associated with a reduction in the absolute risk of ischemic strokes and cardiovascular events. Differences in effects among statins were modest, signaling potential therapeutic equivalence. Trial registration: PROSPERO CRD42018079112

AB  - Aims: To investigate the nature and frequency of prescription modifications in Dutch community pharmacies. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, Dutch community pharmacists documented prescription modifications in their pharmacy during 1 predetermined day. Pharmacists from all Dutch community pharmacies were invited to participate. A prescription modification was defined as any modification in a prescription for a medicine or other healthcare product because of an administrative problem, logistic issue or potential drug-related problem (DRP). All documented modifications were assessed to establish the nature and frequency of prescription modifications. Results: Pharmacists in 275 pharmacies completed the study. A modification was performed in 5.5% of all prescriptions. 1.3% of the prescriptions contained an administrative problem, of which insufficient specification of the dosing regimen was most common (63.1%). A modification was performed due to a logistic issue in 2.4% of the prescriptions. The most frequently recorded issues were unavailability of medication (40.9%) and obligatory product substitutions due to reimbursement policies (33.2%). A modification was performed in 1.8% of the prescriptions to solve or prevent potential DRPs. Of these, 69.2% was potentially clinically relevant according to the pharmacist concerned. The most frequently prevented potential DRP was an incorrect strength or dose (31.9%). Conclusion: Dutch community pharmacists modified almost 1 in 20 prescriptions per pharmacy. The nature of the modifications reflects current community pharmacy practice, in which pharmacists frequently deal with logistic issues and intervene to solve or prevent for DRPs several times a day. The majority of the DRPs were considered to be potentially clinically relevant.

AB  - Background: Adverse drug events (ADE) cause considerable harm to patients, and consequently their detection is critical for patient safety. The US Food and Drug Administration maintains an adverse event reporting system (AERS) to facilitate the detection of ADE in drugs. Various data mining approaches have been developed that use AERS to detect signals identifying associations between drugs and ADE. The signals must then be monitored further by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Objective: To develop a new methodology that combines existing data mining algorithms with chemical information by analysis of molecular fingerprints to enhance initial ADE signals generated from AERS, and to provide a decision support mechanism to facilitate the identification of novel adverse events. Results: The method achieved a significant improvement in precision in identifying known ADE, and a more than twofold signal enhancement when applied to the ADE rhabdomyolysis. The simplicity of the method assists in highlighting the etiology of the ADE by identifying structurally similar drugs. A set of drugs with strong evidence from both AERS and molecular fingerprintbased modeling is constructed for further analysis. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology could be used as a pharmacovigilance decision support tool to facilitate ADE detection.

AB  - A 65-year-old woman with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes (a recent hemoglobin A1C level was 9.5%) reports the recent onset of burning, tingling, and stabbing pain in her feet that is worse at night and interferes with sleep and activities of daily living. Her medications include 500 mg of metformin and 2 mg of glimepiride, each taken twice daily. On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. She has reduced sensation to pinpricks in the knees, reduced ability to detect vibration from a 128-Hz tuning fork, and a loss of proprioception and of sensation to a 1-g monofilament (but not to a 10-g monofilament) in her toes. Strength in the lower legs is 5 out of 5 (normal) proximally and 4 out of 5 distally, and there is slightly weak dorsiflexion of both big toes, with no indication of entrapment. Her ankle reflexes are absent. She has no foot ulcers, and her pulses are easily palpable. How should her case be further evaluated and managed?.

AB  - Brody disease is a rare inherited myopathy due to reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)1 activity caused by mutations in ATP2A1, which causes delayed muscle relaxation and silent cramps. So far the disease has mostly been diagnosed by measurement of SERCA1 activity. Since mutation analysis became more widely available, it has appeared that not all patients with reduced SERCA1 activity indeed have ATP2A1 mutations, and a distinction between Brody disease (with ATP2A1 mutations) and Brody syndrome (without ATP2A1 mutations) was proposed. We aim to compare the clinical features of patients with Brody disease and those with Brody syndrome and detect clinical features which help to distinguish between the two. In addition, we describe the Brody syndrome phenotype in more detail. We therefore performed a literature review on clinical features of both Brody disease and Brody syndrome and a cross-sectional clinical study consisting of questionnaires, physical examination, and a review of medical files in 17 Brody syndrome patients in our centre. The results showed that Brody disease presents with an onset in the 1st decade, a generalized pattern of muscle stiffness, delayed muscle relaxation after repetitive contraction on physical examination, and autosomal recessive inheritance. Patients with Brody syndrome more often report myalgia and experience a considerable impact on daily life. Future research should focus on the possible mechanisms of reduction of SERCA activity in Brody syndrome and other genetic causes, and on evaluation of treatment options. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death that has typical electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns. Recently, there have been reports of Brugada ECG patterns seen in critically ill patients who received propofol,1 and this pattern was associated with a very high imminent mortality. We report a case in which a critically ill patient developed a Brugada ECG pattern following high-dose propofol infusion. Once the ECG pattern was recognized, the propofol was discontinued and the ECG pattern resolved, and the patient was discharged home with no arrhythmic sequelae. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: An opioid overdose crisis is currently ongoing in North America in relation to the misuse of opioid analgesics and the spread of new fentanyl analogues on the recreational scene. Data regarding opioid overdoses in France remains scarce. Our objectives were to describe opioid overdose cases admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and characterize the compounds involved, clinical features, complications and patient management. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-centre observational study including all patients admitted in the ICU during a 10 year period (2008-2018) for opioid overdose evidenced by the typical opioid toxidrome (coma, pinpoint pupils and bradypnea) associated with a compatible blood and urine toxicological screen. Results: In 10 years, 231 patients (147 males and 84 females; age 38 years (33-46) [median (percentiles 25-75)]) were admitted the ICU for opioid intoxication. The patients presented consciousness impairment [Glasgow Coma Score 6 (3-10)], respiratory rate of 11/min (8-15) and pinpoint pupils (90%). Naloxone (64%) and flumazenil (20%) were administered to avoid tracheal intubation; but mechanical ventilation was required in 36% of patients [duration 20 hours (11-72)]. Duration of ICU stay was 41 hours (24-72). The observed complications included aspiration pneumonia (35%), rhabdomyolysis (26%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (13%), cardiovascular failure (11%), withdrawal syndrome (8%), hospital-acquired infection (4%) and death (1%). Toxicity was related to opioid misuse (52%) versus opioid overdose (48%). Multidrug exposure was found in 100% of cases; the opioids involved were as follows: morphine (44%), heroin (32%), buprenorphine (30%), methadone (26%), codeine (24%), tramadol (6%), dextropropoxyphene (6%), fentanyl (1%) and oxycodone (0.5%). Prevalence of the different opioids was mainly influenced by the banning of dextropropoxyphene from the market in 2011 and the consecutive increase in tramadol prescriptions. Conclusion: Our large cohort of opioid poisoning cases clearly supports the risks of life-threatening consequences in case of misuse or overdose. Mixed opioid use and combination with other legal and illegal drugs are frequent, supporting the role of drug-drug interactions in the onset of toxicity in these multidrug poisonings.

AB  - Bariatric surgery requires positioning a morbidly obese patient on a relatively hard operating table which may lead to compression injury of the skeletal muscles and development of kidney failure. A 187 kg (BMI 64 kg/m2) 45-year-old heavy smoker patient with severe peripheral lymphedema and respiratory difficulties was admitted to our clinic. After a 45 days of preparation, a sleeve gastrectomy procedure was performed. The procedure lasted longer (215 minutes) than anticipated due to difficulties in retracting the massive liver. After extubation, she was quite agitated and blood gas analysis revealed carbon dioxide retention and acidosis. Her blood gases were corrected in the intensive care unit with application of BPAP under sedation. When the patient was sent back to the ward next day she developed excruciating back pain and her urine color darkened. Rhabdomyolysis was suspected and a creatine phosphokinase level (CPK) of 11554 U/L confirmed the diagnosis. Massive diuresis with furosemide and mannitol and intensive hydration (over 8 liters a day) corrected the increase in BUN and creatinine. The CPK level was 2280 U/L on the 5th day. She was discharged on the 8th day with oral tramadol due to continuing back pain. On the first postoperative control one week after discharge, she had limited back pain and normal lab results. Although it is a rare complication, rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in all bariatric patients with severe postoperative muscle pain. Diuresis must be induced as soon as possible in order to prevent renal failure. Proper use of soft pads and cushions could prevent development of such lethal complication.

AB  - Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: Richter’s obturator hernia is a rare abdominal hernia that is difficult to diagnose. The purpose of this case report is to show an unusual presentation of a fatal Richter’s obturator hernia that was accompanied by a femoral abscess. Case Report: An 89-year-old woman complained of sudden left coxalgia and a gait disorder but no abdominal symptoms. She had no history of trauma or surgery in the inguinal area. Twenty-three days after her first complaint of coxalgia, the patient was admitted in a coma with necrotizing fasciitis in the left inguinal area. The patient died of asystole due to hyperkalemia. During surveillance for the cause of death, a Richter’s type of incarcerated obturator hernia was identified at autopsy. The incarcerated small intestine had penetrated into the left obturator foramen to form an abscess that extended into the deep femoral region. Conclusions: Obturator hernia accompanied by femoral abscess is extremely rare, but it should be suspected when a patient with no history of trauma or surgery has a femoral abscess, even in the absence of abdominal symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND Rhabdomyolysis develops as a result of skeletal muscle cell collapse from leakage of the intracellular contents into circulation. In severe cases, it can be associated with acute kidney injury and disseminated intravascular coagulation, leading to life threatening outcomes. Rhabdomyolysis can occur in the perioperative period from various etiologies but is rarely induced by tourniquet use during orthopedic surgery. CASE SUMMARY A 77-year-old male underwent right total knee arthroplasty using a tourniquet under spinal anesthesia. About 24 h after surgery, he was found in a drowsy mental state and manifested features of severe rhabdomyolysis, including fever, hypotension, oliguria, high creatine kinase, myoglobinuria, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Despite supportive care, cardiac arrest developed abruptly, and the patient was not able to be resuscitated. CONCLUSION Severe rhabdomyolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation can develop from surgical tourniquet, requiring prompt, aggressive treatments to save the patient. © 2022. The Author(s).
